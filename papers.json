The serum is applied directly to a thin-layer plate and after partition with one developing solvent the fractions are charred with 10% sulphuric acid. Charring takes 20 minutes. The concentration of triglycerides is measured against a triolein standard, which in itself is corrected for having too many double bonds by scanning the charring of the triglyceride fraction with a “flying spot”-scanner or a slitscanner. The results are compared with other methods of determination."

  "abstract": "Firms protected by antidumping measures do not unequivocally benefit from them. Antidumping protection benefits non-exporters active on the protected market by raising their domestic sales, but hurts exporters of similar products as the protected ones. Export sales of protected firms fall by almost 8% compared to a relevant control group of unprotected firms. This effect more than doubles for firms that are global, i.e. firms with foreign affiliates. Measured at the product-level, extra-EU exports of goods protected by antidumping fall by 36% while exports to target countries fall by as much as 66% following protection. Protection also has an effect on the extensive margin, by raising the probability to start exporting for firms that were initially non-exporters. Existing exporters face a higher probability to stop exporting during protection. Finally, we find that the productivity of exporters falls while that of non-exporters rises during antidumping protection. We offer a number of plausible explanations for our findings that stem from the heterogeneous firm literature. We also discuss the importance of our findings for policy."

In previous works we have proposed a hybrid wired/wireless PROFIBUS network solution where the interconnection between the heterogeneous communication media was accomplished through bridge-like interconnecting devices. The resulting networking architecture embraced a Multiple Logical Ring (MLR) approach, thus with multiple independent tokens, to which a specific bridging protocol extension, the Inter-Domain Protocol (IDP), was proposed. The IDP offers compatibility with standard PROFIBUS, and includes mechanisms to support inter-cell mobility of wireless nodes. In this paper we advance that work by proposing a worst-case response timing analysis of the IDP."

The key step cleaning topological relationship after\n data collection of polygonal layer is to build polygonal objects from digital arcs. The raw digital arcs may intersect with\n each other. The algorithm for building polygonal objects after the raw arcs have been split at all intersections is presented.\n The build-up of polygonal objects in this paper is designed to be implemented by two steps. The first step is to extract all\n the polygons needed for build-up of polygonal objects from arcs. The second step is to organize polygonal objects from these\n polygons. For the first step, a tracing algorithm is proposed. The algorithm merely extracts the polygons needed for the build-up\n of polygonal objects, which is a subset of all the possible polygons that can be induced from the arcs. For the second step,\n an algorithm based on a specially designed order of polygons is advanced. All the topological relationships among the polygons\n are shown in a single scan. Experiments show that the two algorithms together offer a robust and efficient solution for building\n polygonal objects from intersected arcs."

  "abstract": "Understanding the intracellular trafficking of nanoparticles internalized by mammalian cells is a critical issue in nanomedicine, intimately linked to therapeutic applications but also to toxicity concerns. While the uptake mechanisms of carbon nanotubes and polymeric particles have been investigated fairly extensively, there are few studies on the migration and fate of protein-only nanoparticles other than natural viruses. Interestingly, protein nanoparticles are emerging as tools in personalized medicines because of their biocompatibility and functional tuneability, and are particularly promising for gene therapy and also conventional drug delivery. Here, we have investigated the uptake and kinetics of intracellular migration of protein nanoparticles built up by a chimerical multifunctional protein, and functionalized by a pleiotropic, membrane-active (R9) terminal peptide. Interestingly, protein nanoparticles are first localized in endosomes, but an early endosomal escape allows them to reach and accumulate in the nucleus (but not in the cytoplasm), with a migration speed of 0.0044 ± 0.0003 μm/s, ten-fold higher than that expected for passive diffusion. Interestingly, the plasmatic, instead of the nuclear membrane is the main cellular barrier in the nuclear way of R9-assisted protein-only nanoparticles."

  "abstract": "Summary 1 It is unclear whether soil seed banks in alpine environments are a result of selection for extended seed dormancy, of ideal conditions for seed preservation in the soil, or a combination of both. 2 The nature of the soil seed bank was investigated in the perennial herb Phacelia secunda (Hydrophyllaceae) through reciprocal burial experiments using seeds obtained from populations growing at 1600, 2200, 2900 and 3400 m a.s.l. in the mediterranean Andes of central Chile. At the four elevations, six replicates of 50 seeds each, from each of the four elevational sources, were buried at 5 cm depth in mesh envelopes, placed in wire cages to protect against predation. Seeds were retrieved 1, 2 and 3 years after burial, and numbers of ungerminated seeds, and of those that remained viable, were determined. 3 At all elevations of seed burial, increasing proportions of seeds remained ungerminated, and proportionately more of the ungerminated seeds remained viable, as elevation of source of seed increased. For seed from low elevation, more seeds remained viable in the soil at the higher burial sites. However, for the seeds from higher elevation sources, seeds remaining viable were similar in number at all sites for seed burial. Half-lives of seed buried at the source elevation, calculated from the log-logistic distribution, increased with elevation, and ranged from 188 days at 1600 m to 354 days at 3400 m. 4 The results suggest that the propensity to form a persistent seed bank in P. secunda increases with elevation. Seeds from the highest elevations had the longest persistence, and this was largely unaffected by soil preservation conditions. Seeds from lower elevations survived for less time, and this was modifiable by preservation conditions. These results suggest that both selective effects and soil conditions may be involved in soil seed bank expression in the alpine environment."

  "abstract": "A generic interpretation of pulsar radio emission that does not rely on the identi- fication of a specific emission mechanism is explored. Cohere nce is quantified in terms of a coherence factor, which implies a maximum brightness temperature; the possible significance of Poincare invariants is pointed out, and the potential us e of higher order moments of the intensity to measure the coherence is discussed. The effect of the Lorentz boost between the plasma rest frame and the pulsar frame, the suppression of emission at low frequencies due to curvature of the field lines, and a natural frequency of the pulsar plasma are incorporated into a generic model for pulsar emission, and three illustra tive examples of its possible use are given."

  "abstract": "Objective: Quality assurance(QA) of intensity modulated radiotherapy(IMRT) dosimetry is a laborious task.The goal of this work is to evaluate the dosimetric characteristics of a new 2D diode array and assess the role it can play in routine IMRT QA.Methods: A diode array,MapCHECKTM and MapPHAN phantom from Sun Nuclear corporation(USC) were used for verifying the dose distribution of 10 tomotherapy IMRT plan cases.The combined phantom was set up to measure the dose distribution from coronal and sagittal orientations.After MVCT registration,the measured dose distributions of the coronal and sagittal planes were compared with those from calculation in the planning system.The results were evaluated by the absolute doses.The feasibility of the different measuring methods were studied.Results: The dose distribution measured by the MapCHECKTM 2D array was well consistent with that calculated by tomotherapy planning system.In the comparison of the MapCHECKTM measured versus planning system calculated using the 3mm/3% and 4mm/4% γ criteria,the number of detectors with γ parameter ≤1 was 96.8%/99.38% and 96.99%/99.49% average of the 10 cases respectively,for coronal and sagit-tal orientations.The acceptance criteria which is the combined 3mm/3% analysis would be introduced.And the number of points required to \"pass\" was generally 90%.Conclusions: MapCHECKTM with MapPHAN phantom has been successfully tested for HT dose verification,and offers users an accurate and convenient rotational dosimetry solution."

  "abstract": "A beam direct converter of the Kyoto type that uses magnetic separation of the D+ and Dleaving the neu� tralizer, is adapted to a Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory concept of a neutralbeam injector for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, which used elec� trostatic separation of the D+ and D� . Among the advan� tages of a direct converter over an ordinary beam dump for the residual D+ and Dbeam leaving the neutralizer is that the power density on the beam dump is reduced by a large factor, making heat removal easier. Further, \"soft landing\" virtually eliminates deuteriumdeuterium neutron production on the dump electrodes, a particular advantage in the development stage. In addition, the total power consumed is less. This paper addresses the technological obstacle to feasibility, which is holding the large voltage � +1.6 and � 1.6 MV for a 1.6� MeV neutral beam� . The electrode system in the present design uses 15 grading electrodes around each 1.6 MV collector with 100 kV between them. Each grading electrode is subdi� vided into two. The total stored energy is 260 J � 4 J per electrodeand an average of 10 kV/cm on the insulators. The calculated eciency is 92�."

The following study was designed to investigate whether inositol has beneficial effects in another disorder shown to be responsive to SSRIs: premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Eleven female patients with PMDD diagnosed according to DSM-IV participated in a cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The active drug was myo-inositol, 12 g daily, whereas placebo was d-glucose administered at the same dose. Each drug was given during the luteal phase only (14 days prior to menses). For each patient treatment alternated between these two drugs for six menstrual cycles. No beneficial effect was demonstrated for inositol over placebo."

  "abstract": "A distributed computing application uses multiple networked computers to work together to accomplish a big task. It can be used to solve calculation-intensive problems such as weather forecasting and astronomical analyzing. There are many common tasks among different kinds of applications. To reduce the development cycle, the goal of this paper is to design and implement an API for constructing distributed applications. In this paper, the core functions of the API are discussed, and a real application written by the API is demonstrated."

  "abstract": "The recruitment of transcriptional coactivators, including histone modifying enzymes, is an important step in transcription regulation. A typical activator is thought to interact with several cofactors, presumably in a sequential manner. The common use of several cofactors raises the question of how activators achieve both cofactor selectivity and diversity. Human STAGA is a multiprotein complex with the acetyltransferase GCN5L as the catalytic subunit. Here, we first show, through RNA interference-mediated knock-down and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, that GCN5 plays a role in p53-dependent gene activation. We then employ p53 mutagenesis, in vitro binding, protein-protein cross-linking, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to establish a novel role for the second p53 activation subdomain (AD2) in STAGA recruitment and, further, to demonstrate that optimal binding of STAGA to p53 involves interactions of STAGA subunits TAF9, GCN5, and ADA2b, respectively, with AD1, AD2, and carboxy-terminal domains of p53. These results provide concrete evidence for mediation of transcription factor binding to coactivator complexes through multiple interactions. Based on our data, we propose a cooperative and modular binding mode for the recruitment of coactivator complexes to promoters."

  "abstract": "Modifications of mucosal phospholipids have been detected in samples from patients with Helicobacter pylori-positive gastritis. These alterations appear secondary to increased phospholipase A2 activity (PLA2). The cytosolic form of this enzyme (cPLA2), normally involved in cellular signaling and growth, has been implicated in cancer pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate cPLA2 expression and PLA2 activity in the gastric mucosae of patients with and without H. pylori infection. In gastric biopsies from 10 H. pylori-positive patients, cPLA2 levels, levels of mRNA as determined by reverse transcriptase PCR, levels of protein as determined by immunohistochemistry, and total PLA2 activity were higher than in 10 H. pylori-negative gastritis patients. To clarify whether H. pylori had a direct effect on the cellular expression of cPLA2, we studied cPLA2 expression in vitro with different human epithelial cell lines, one from a patient with larynx carcinoma (i.e., HEp-2 cells) and two from patients with gastric adenocarcinoma (i.e., AGS and MKN 28 cells), incubated with different H. pylori strains. The levels of cPLA2, mRNA, and protein expression were unchanged in Hep-2 cells independently of cellular adhesion or invasion of the bacteria. Moreover, no change in cPLA2 protein expression was observed in AGS or MKN 28 cells treated with wild-type H. pylori. In conclusion, our study shows increased cPLA2 expression and PLA2 activity in the gastric mucosae of patients with H. pylori infection and no change in epithelial cell lines exposed to H. pylori."

There are 16 families with great differences among the tested 55 families compared with control plot, however, it is infeasible to eliminate through clones; while it is feasible to select in early stage with annual limitation at least 6 years above based on related analysis about tree height growth and year; result shows that the tree height and DBH among the families have great differences according to equation analysis on actual tested data over the tree height and DBH during 16 years affrostation. There are 11 families reached obvious differences with both tree height and DBH at the sanme time accounting for 20% among the tested families; what 11 families selected can be used as materials for establishing the second generation plot for Cunninghamia laceolata and also can be improved materials for extension and application."

A total of 160 one- day - old Hysex Brown broiler chicks were used in the experiment. There were eight groups each containing 20 chicks. The experiment lasted seven weeks. In the group which was fed the ration containing raw soybean, live weight decreased 49.08% compared to the control group. While the raw soybean caused considerable pancreatic hypertrophy and hyperplasia, fatty liver and passive hyperemia, and tubulonephritis in the kidney were detected in all the groups excluding the control group. There were no pathological alterations in the heart or spleen."

  "abstract": "The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) has been used successfully across diverse cultural settings. However, a recent study found poor validity in detecting postnatal common mental disorders (CMD) in rural Ethiopia. Using similar methodology, the study was replicated in the capital, Addis Ababa.Semantic, content and criterion validity of EPDS, Kessler Scale-6 (K6) and Kessler Scale-10 (K10) were assessed in postnatal women attending vaccination clinics. Criterion validation was undertaken on 100 postnatal women, with local psychiatrist diagnosis of CMD using the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS) as the criterion measure.The areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve for the EPDS, K6 and K10 were 0.85 (95%CI 0.77-0.92), 0.86 (95%CI 0.76-0.97) and 0.87 (95%CI 0.78-0.97), respectively. The EPDS generated sensitivity, specificity and misclassification rates of 78.9%, 75.3% and 24.0%, respectively at an optimal cut-off point of 6/7. The corresponding values for the K6 were 84.2%, 82.7% and 17.0% at a cut-off point of 4/5, and for K10 were 84.2%, 77.8% and 21.0% at a cut-off point of 6/7, respectively. The internal reliability Cronbach's alpha for the EPDS, K6 and K10 were 0.71, 0.86 and 0.90, respectively.Not all postnatal women bring their infants to vaccination clinics which may limit generalisability.The EPDS, K6 and K10 all demonstrated acceptable clinical utility as screening scales for postnatal CMD in an urban setting in Ethiopia. The marked urban-rural difference in EPDS performance within Ethiopia highlights the difficulty of applying urban-validated instruments to rural settings in LAMIC."

Using normative Delphi method which spanned to two rounds, a comprehensive questionnaire was developed through which panelists were asked to rate, select, and add (if necessary) from the list of diverse set of issues along-with their best available solutions in the dimension of ICT strategic framework for tertiary education. Panelists not only discussed ICT-based issues and their proposed solutions but also stratified a ZPD incidence development strategy which chalks out measures HE authorities should take in order to properly integrate ICTs in their HEIs. It was determined that ICT integration in HE need to be in lined with proper strategy in order to get their true benefits."

  "abstract": "Online discussion forums are popular social media platforms for users to express their opinions and discuss controversial issues with each other. To automatically identify the sides/stances of posts or users from textual content in forums is an important task to help mine online opinions. To tackle the task, it is important to exploit user posts that implicitly contain support and dispute (interaction) information. The challenge we face is how to mine such interaction information from the content of posts and how to use them to help identify stances. This paper proposes a two-stage solution based on latent variable models: an interaction feature identification stage to mine interaction features from structured debate posts with known sides and reply intentions; and a clustering stage to incorporate interaction features and model the interplay between interactions and sides for debate side clustering. Empirical evaluation shows that the learned interaction features provide good insights into user interactions and that with these features our debate side model shows significant improvement over other baseline methods."

  "abstract": "This paper describes a novel implementation of the progressive refinement radiosity algorithm. Algorithm performance is greatly enhanced using the capabilities of a multiprocessor graphics workstation. Hemi-cube item buffers are produced using the graphics hardware while the remaining computations are performed in parallel on the multiple host processors. Speedups of a factor of 40 or more over the equivalent software implementation are observed. Load balancing issues are discussed and a system performance model is developed based on actual results.Additionally, a new user interface scheme is presented where the radiosity calculations and walk-through tasks are separated. At each new iteration, the radiosity algorithm automatically updates colors used by the viewing program via shared memory while simultaneously obtaining hints on where to further refine the solution."

  "abstract": "This paper provides direct evidence supporting the tax-loss selling hypothesis as an explanation of the January effect. Examining turn-of-the-year return and volume patterns for municipal bond closed-end funds, which are held mostly by tax-sensitive individual investors, we document a January effect for these funds, but not for their underlying assets. We provide evidence that this effect can be largely explained by tax-loss selling activities at the previous year-end. Moreover, we find that funds as- sociated with brokerage firms display more tax-loss selling behavior, suggesting that tax counseling plays a role. AMONG THE NUMEROUS STOCK RETURN ANOMALIES, probably none has generated more interest than that of the \"turn-of-the-year\" or \"January\" effect, the phe- nomenon in which small capitalization stocks realize unusually high returns in early January.1 The literature offers a number of hypotheses to explain this phenomenon including the tax-loss selling hypothesis, the window dressing hypothesis, the insider trading (information release) hypothesis, and the sea- sonality of the risk-return relation hypothesis. Given existing evidence in some support for the first two hypotheses, the debate continues with respect to which of these, the tax-loss selling of individual investors or the window dressing of"

Our results indicated that the Brownish-flanked Bush Warbler suffered from high predation rate and relatively high parasitism rate of 49.26% and 9.18%, respectively. Reflectance analysis showed that the hue and chroma of Lesser Cuckoo eggs were highly mimetic but the egg brightness and ultraviolet reflectance were different from the bush warbler."

  "abstract": "Methods for characterizing video segments and allowing fast search in large archives are becoming essential in the video information flood. In this paper, we present a method for characterizing and clustering video segments using cumulative color histogram. The underlying assumption is that a video segment has a consistent color palette, which can be derived as a family of merged individual shot histograms. These merged histograms (SuperHistograms) are clustered using a Nearest Neighbor-clustering algorithm. Given a query video, in order to find similar videos, the SuperHistogram of the video will be generated and compared to the centers of the Nearest Neighbor clusters. The video clips in the cluster with center nearest to the query, can be searched to find video clips most similar to the query video. This method can be used in a variety of applications that need video classification and retrieval methods such as video editing, video archival, digital libraries, consumer products, and web crawling."

  "abstract": "The partition of heavy metals between octanol and water in the presence of surfactants has been investigated. It is shown that metal ions can be extracted from water into the organic phase, n-octanol, as a model for biological materials in the presence of various anionic surfactants. Anions such as chromate can be extracted with the help of certain cationic surfactants. It was found that the extent of extraction depends on various parameters, such as the concentration of the surfactant, ionic strength and pH. With some anionic surfactants, the K(ow) of lead or cadmium can reach values of 200 from waters of low ionic strength, decreasing as the ionic strength increases."

The mRNA and protein expressions of the cytokines in the isolated and purified PMNs were assayed by reverse transcriptional (RT)-PCR, Western blotting and enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively.Kle.p infection induced the mRNA expressions of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta in the early stage, and TNF-alpha mRNA reached its peak at 6 h and IL-1beta mRNA at 12 h after infection, both of which decreased 24 h after infection. Western blot analysis showed that the protein expressions of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta were the highest at 6 h, and decreased obviously at 24 h after infection. ELISA showed that the secretion of TNF-alpha peaked at 6 h and decreased obviously at 24 h after infection, while the peak of IL-1beta production occurred at 12 h and maintained the high level till 24 h after the infection.TNF-alpha may participate in the immune defense of PMN against Kle.p infection mainly in the early stage of infection while IL-1beta mainly in the later stage."

  "abstract": "During rapid head rotations, saccades ipsiversive with compensatory vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) slow phases may augment the deficient VOR and assist gaze stabilization in space. The present experiments compared these vestibular catch-up saccades (VCUSs) with visually and memory-guided saccades. To characterize VCUSs and their relationship to deficiency of the initial VOR, we delivered random, whole-body transients of 1000 and 2800 degrees/s2 peak yaw acceleration around four different eccentric vertical axes in eight unilaterally and one bilaterally vestibulopathic subjects, as well as nine age-matched normal subjects. Eye and head movements were sampled at 1200 Hz using magnetic search coils. Subjects fixed targets at either 500 or 15 cm distance immediately before unpredictable onset of rotation in darkness. Under all testing conditions, normal subjects exhibited only compensatory vestibular slow phases and occasional anticompensatory quick phases. This behavior was also typical of unilaterally vestibulopathic subjects rotated contralesionally. When rotated ipsilesionally, however, vestibulopathic subjects had deficient slow-phase VOR gain with prolonged latency, and six of the nine exhibited saccadic movements in the compensatory direction (VCUSs). Higher head accelerations preferentially evoked VCUSs, but there were no preferred combinations of target distances and eccentric rotation axes. Peak velocities and durations of VCUSs increased with saccade amplitude. The latency distribution for VCUSs peaked around 70 ms, substantially shorter than reported for either visually guided express saccades or vestibular memory contingent saccades. The latency of each VCUS was highly correlated with the gaze error prior to that VCUS. The amplitude of VCUSs was calibrated to gaze position error, such that VCUSs reduced gaze error by an average of 37%. Thus when VOR slow-phase responses cannot compensate fully for head rotation, vestibular gaze position error can nevertheless calibrate the programming of VCUSs to augment the deficient VOR, much like catch-up saccades substitute for deficient visual pursuit."

  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Conventional external fixation materials, including gypsum bandages, small splints and OCL splints, are unsatisfactory due to their poor histocompatibility. OBJECTIVE: To study the histocompatibility of medical suspended compound anti-anaphylaxis ventilated plaster splint in clinical application by the incidence of skin hypersensitivity, pressure ulcer and osteofascial compartment syndrome, and compare with the therapeutic effect of traditional small splint, traditional gypsum bandage and OCL plaster splint. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: A retrospective analysis based on cases was carried out at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery in Shiyan Hospital of Baoan District of Shenzhen between January 2006 and January 2008. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 225 patients with limbs fractures were treated with plaster splints and received follow-ups. According to the external fixation materials, the patients were divided into 4 groups: traditional small splint group (n=42), traditional gypsum bandage group (n=83), suspended compound anti-anaphylaxis ventilated plaster splint (n=78), and OCL plaster splint group (n=22). INTERVENTIONS: Suspended compound anti-anaphylaxis ventilated plaster splint was self-designed and manufactured by Dalian Anlite Medical Equipment Co.,Ltd; OCL plaster splint was produced in America. They were all used for external fixation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Histocompatibility indexes, such as the incidence of skin hypersensitivity, pressure ulcer and osteofascial compartment syndrome. RESULTS: External fixation time of 225 patients ranged 4-12 weeks, with a mean of 6.2 weeks. The incidences of skin hypersensitivity, pressure ulcer and osteofascial compartment syndrome in the suspended compound anti-anaphylaxis ventilated plaster splint were lower than other three groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Suspended compound anti-anaphylaxis ventilated plaster splint has good histocompatibility, safety and reliability, thus fitting for external fixation of the fractures."

In particular, we have measured dielectrons\n(e+e-) from p-p and p-d collisions to understand the basic dilepton production\nmechanisms in the energy range from 1.05 - 4.9 GeV. These data can be used to\ndetermine the basic processes which contribute to nucleon-nucleon dilepton\nproduction such as hadronic bremsstrahlung, vector meson processes, and\nhadronic Dalitz decay. The data show that a simple elastic bremsstrahlung\ncalculation is insufficient to explain the data. Theoretical models are\ncompared with the data. A new high statistics study of Ca-Ca at 1.05 A GeV has\nbeen made to study the collectivity of A-A collisions."

Exploratory factor analyses suggested that a 15-item, 3-factor solution representing men's attitudes toward their body fat, muscularity, and height best described the data. The internal consistency and construct validity of scores on the Revised Male Body Attitudes Scale suggest that this measure holds promise as an indicant of men's attitudes toward their physical appearance. Limitations and strengths associated with the current research are discussed and directions for future research are outlined.

  "abstract": "SSR molecular markers which had the technical advantages of fast, stable and accurate were used to investigate the genetic diversity and purity test of two hybrid seed commercially available. 36 rice SSR primer pairs were used to assess the genetic diversity of 38 hybrid rice samples. The result showed two of the sample were heterogenous (genetic distance 0.11), whereas two of the others seemed to be synonym (genetic distance 0.03). 33 maize SSR primer pairs were used to determine the genetic diversity of 36 hybrid maize sample, the result showed two of the sample were heterogenous (genetic distance 0.12). In the artificial mixed sample test, u test revealed there was no significant difference between all sample test value and actual mixed ratio. Meanwhile, 10 hybrid rice samples provided by seed company were compared with SSR molecular marker and field identification methods, though SSR marker test results were below the field identification in threesamples, the field identifying were on the basis of agronomic traits, it was difficult to distinguish the similar genetic background strains, it indicated that SSR molecular marker was more favorable than the other detection methods."

  "abstract": "Migration of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) across the internal elastic lamina is a key step in the development of atherosclerotic or restenotic plaques. Cell movement is a complex and highly dynamic phenomenon, involving the continuous formation and breakage of attachments with the underlying substratum. Tenascin-C (Tn-C), a counter-adhesive extracellular matrix protein, is comprised of several isoforms with distinct biological activities. Neither the structure nor function of these isoforms in SMCs has been defined. We have used primers and RT-PCR to fully identify Tn-C isoforms expressed by SMCs. Cloning and sequence analysis of the PCR product indicated that SMCs express a Tn-C isoform with only repeats A1 and A2 of fibronectin type III repeats. Using A1A2-specific antibodies, cDNA probes and RNase mapping, we observed that the A1A2 isoform is predominantly expressed by cultured SMCs derived from aorta of newborn rats, and its expression is up-regulated by PDGF-BB. In contrast, the expression of this isoform is markedly down-regulated in the SMCs derived from adult rat aorta. Western and Northern blots of injured rat carotid arteries revealed that the A1A2-isoform is expressed in response to injury. Using cultured SMCs, we found that the recombinant A1A2 protein that was found in the newly discovered Tn-C isoform promotes SMC chemotaxis. We conclude that Tn-C isoforms are expressed in a regulated fashion in vascular system. Our findings suggest a new role of Tn-C isoforms in the remodeling of vascular wall."

  "abstract": "The recently cloned ATM gene is mutated in patients with ataxia telangiectasia, but its biological functions remain to be experimentally determined. Structural analysis has revealed ATM sequence similarities to the catalyticdomainsof phosphatidyl-3kinase and other membersof this family of yeast and mammalian proteins. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against polypeptide regions unique to the COOH terminus and to the NH2terminus of the published ATM sequence confirm ATM as Mr â€\"350,000 protein in normal cells, which is missing in AT cells. Immuno precipitated protein(s) is capable of phosphorylating IicB-a in an in vitro kinase assay. However, we did not observe a phosphatidyl-3 kinase or a DNA-dependentprotein kinase function by ATM immunoprecipitates. These data support a protein kinase activity for ATM and suggest a role in NF-icBactivation."

  "abstract": "Cortisol secretion after awakening, an index of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, appears to be related to psychosocial stressors, or to symptoms caused by psychosocial stressors. The relationship between the quality, duration, and magnitude of psychosocial factors and cortisol secretion is however, unclear. Therefore, the effect of episodic stress associated with writing a graduation thesis on cortisol secretion after awakening was investigated. Saliva samples were collected from 10 undergraduate students at awakening, and 30, 45, and 60 min after awakening 1 month, 2 weeks, and a few days before the thesis submission and 1 week after the submission. They also completed the Short form of Profile of Moods Scale (POMS-S) on the night before each sampling. Results indicated that cortisol levels were higher a few days before the thesis submission compared to 1 month before submission. Scores of \"Fatigue\" and \"Tension-Anxiety\" in POMS-S were also higher a few days before submission. These results suggest that episodic stress associated with writing a graduation thesis caused an increase in cortisol levels after awakening."

  "abstract": "Summary  From molecular distillation data, and information obtained by hydrogenation in dilute solution, extents of reaction have been\n calculated for the polymerization of linseed, safflower, tung, and oiticica oils. The hydrogenation data indicate that more\n than one double bond per molecule can be consumed during polymerization.\n \n The kinetic order of the polymerization of nonconjugated oils increases from an initial value of unity to approach a value\n of two. With conjugated oils, second-order characteristics were maintained during the course of the bodying. An explanation\n of this difference in reaction order based on monomer disappearance is presented. Rate constants and overall energies of activation\n were calculated and compared with those obtained from viscosity measurements. Agreement between the two sets of values was\n obtained. Oiticica oil, which gives curved viscosity plots that cannot be resolved, has been treated successfully in this\n manner.\n \n \n \n Intraglyceride reactions have been studied, and differences in behavior between nonconjugated and conjugated oils at high\n and low polymerization temperatures have been observed.\n \n \n "

  "abstract": "There is no effective treatment for patients with stage IV renal cell cancer (RCC), although the introduction of new therapy is imminent. Cancer gene therapy is currently considered to be one of the most promising therapeutic modalities in the field of cancer treatment. Based on the results of animal studies, vaccination using autologous granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-transduced renal cancer cells appears promising. Before initiating a clinical study using an ex vivo gene-transduced autologous cell vaccine-based immunogene therapy for RCC in Japan, in 1992 we initially planned a Japanese version of a clinical protocol in collaboration with a US group. In 1993, the original protocol was refined. We performed five preclinical qualification studies using RCC nephrectomy specimens from patients in 1997, and the results showed that preparation of RCC cells for autologous vaccines at the Clinical Cell Technology Facility, Research Hospital of the Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, was feasible. Subsequently in August 1998, the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Ministry of Education, Science, Culture, and Sport approved our clinical protocol. We have recruited two patients with stage IV RCC to our study so far. Here we report the background to the initiation of cancer gene therapy in Japan."

  "abstract": "The trace amine-associated receptor genes (TAARs) have been considered as important candidates for both schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) based on mapping,1, 2 expression3 and association of TAAR6 (a.k.a. TRAR4) with BD and SZ.4, 5 Clinical studies have demonstrated elevated urinary levels of one of the trace amines (-phenylethylamine) in SZ and BD patients.6, 7 To replicate the reported association and further explore roles of other trace amine receptors in BD susceptibility, we performed a family-based association analysis of all the known nine TAAR genes in 1310 samples, which consisted of 989 samples from the NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health) Genetics Initiative for Bipolar Disorder Waves 1–4 series (including waves 1–2: 23 trios and 83 quads; waves 3–4: 22 trios and 112 quads); 83 samples from the Clinical Neurogenetics (CNG) series (including 6 trios and 8 quads); and 238 samples from the Chicago-Hopkins-Intramural Project (CHIP) series (including 14 trios and 49 quads). The NIMH wave 3 samples showed linkage with 6q23 in previous genome scan study.8 All affected children met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar or schizoaffective bipolar type based on the Diagnostic Instrument for Genetic Studies, medical records and information from family informants. We used the affection status model that includes BPI, BPII and schizoaffective bipolar type in our association analyses. BPI only model was also tested. All samples were Caucasian except for nine families, which were identified as African or Asian by STRUCTURE9 analysis using 254 unlinked SNPs (data not shown). These nine families (five in CNG and waves 1 and 2; four in waves 3 and 4 and CHIP) were excluded from analyses: 110 offspring in the families were females and 185 were males. The statistical power analysis performed using PBAT (http://www.biostat.harvard.edu/~clange/default.htm) (Supplementary Table S1) shows that this whole Caucasian sample (63 trios and 245 quads) has 80% power to detect association with odds ratios of 1.7 and 1.5 for allele frequency of 0.1 and 0.5, respectively. Our strategy was to test a set of SNPs in a screening sample and to follow up SNPs that were nominally significant in our sample or in previous studies in a follow-up sample. Finally, SNPs were analyzed in the combined sample. Results in the follow-up sample were corrected for the number of tests performed for the markers genotyped in this sample. Results in the combined sample were corrected for the total number (30) of tests performed. Initially, we genotyped 30 SNPs in the CNG and NIMH wave 1–2 samples. The SNPs were selected from the HapMap Caucasian genotype data (release 16c.1) in the 127 kb region on 6q23, where all nine known trace amine receptor genes are located. We used Carlson's LD-Select algorithm10 to select tag SNPs (tSNPs) with r20.85, minor allele frequency (MAF)0.1, one tSNP from each linkage disequilibrium (LD) bin. SNPs with previously reported signals in SZ and BD, including rs4305745, rs6903874, rs6937506, rs8192624 and rs8192625 were also selected (Table 1). The average genotyping success rates were 99.80 and 98.75% for pyrosequencing (two SNPs) and for TaqMan assays (28 SNPs), respectively. TDT tests using ASPEX 2.5/sib_tdt (http://aspex.sourceforge.net/) detected four SNPs, including rs9389008, rs4628126, rs1569651 and rs9321360 nominally associated with BD (P<0.05, Table 1). Haplotype blocks were identified by Haploview using the solid spine of LD (Supplementary Figure S1) and then analyzed for association by PDTPHASE.11 One distal haplotype in the TAAR4 gene (named Hap1 here, which includes rs9389008, rs4628126, rs4320395 and rs12189813) showed nominal association with BD (P=0.0063), with false discovery rate12 q=0.071. We then genotyped 12 SNPs in a second sample set including CHIP and NIMH wave 3–4 samples. SNP rs8192624 showed nominally significant association (P=0.022) in the second set of samples (Table 1), as well as in the combined samples (P=0.0048). SNPs rs8192625 and rs4628126 showed P not greater than 0.05 only in combined data analysis (Table 1). The haplotype Hap1 in this region showed similar results (P=0.13 in the second set sample; P=0.015 in combined data). The major allele (G) of SNP rs8192624 and rs8192625 in TAAR6 gene was reported to be associated with BD or SZ.4, 5 Here, we observed nominally significant association between minor allele (A) and BD. The reported allele frequency4 is similar to that observed in this study. This alleviated our concern for allele call errors as a cause of the discrepant results. TAAR6 is in a region where most markers are not in LD with each other. We resequenced a 1 kb exonic fragment and 1 kb of putative promoter of TAAR6 in 189 unrelated BD patients from NIMH BD Genetics Initiative and 188 age- and gender-matched mentally healthy unrelated controls from the NIMH Schizophrenia Genetics Initiative collection. Controls were defined as those who did not meet criteria for BD, schizoaffective disorder or SZ. In addition, our selected controls did not meet criteria for panic or recurrent depression that could be met by the diagnostic interview used for that collection. Twenty-four variants, including eight common variants (MAF>0.05), were identified from the resequencing. Fifteen of these variants were novel. Eleven variants were in a coding region with one synonymous and 10 nonsynonymous mutations (Supplementary Table S2). We looked for a potential rare variant association, as implied in other studies.13 One common synonymous variant (P26P) was detected in both cases and controls. Four missense mutations appeared uniquely in cases and one missense mutation appeared only in controls. However, no significant difference of distribution or amount of coding mutations was found between the BD and control samples. All singletons identified in patients were inherited from parents, as found by additional sequencing, and some from psychiatrically unaffected parents. The resequencing data revealed very low LD among most variants in the TAAR6 gene region (data not shown). It is consistent with the rough map from the HapMap project. This also suggests that a true association, if any, in this region may only be detected by testing the causal variant directly. In conclusion, the present study did not support strong association of either common or rare variants in the TAAR6 gene with BD susceptibility. SNPs rs8192624 and rs8192625 in TAAR6 and a haplotype in TAAR4 gene region remain interesting for possible minor contribution to disease susceptibility. Other candidate genes in this region should be further investigated. Supplementary Information accompanies the paper on the Molecular Psychiatry website (http://www.nature.com/mp)"

After 9/11 and the following Afghan War, especially after several times of Color Revolutions in Central Asian States in the past years, new characteristics of the security situation emerged in this region, and the relevant powers continuously revised the opinion of security surroundings in Central Asia and the definition according to their own interests. All of these factors would effect the future security situation of Central Asia. In the future, the security situation of Central Asia would face challenges, crisis, confrontation and chances, there was also the possibility to moderate and"

  "abstract": "This paper describes software to facilitate research on the automatic derivation of hierarchical (Schenkerian) musical structures from a musical surface. Many MIR tasks require information about musical structure, or would perform better if such information were available. Automatic derivation of musical structure faces two sig- nificant obstacles. Firstly, the solution space of possible structural analyses of a piece is very large. Secondly, pieces can have more than one valid structural analysis, and there is little firm agreement among music theorists about how to distinguish a good analysis. To circumvent the first of these obstacles, software has been developed which derives a tractable 'matrix' of possibilities from a musical surface (i.e., MIDI-like note-time information). The matrix is somewhat like the intermediate results of a dynamic-programming algorithm, and in a similar way it is possible to extract a particular structural analysis from the matrix by following the appropriate path from the top level to the surface. It therefore provides a tool to facilitate research on the second obstacle by allowing candidate 'goodness' metrics to be incorporated into the software and tested on actual music."

The damage energy was calculated reversely from the dent depth, and the hammer’s mass and impact speed were determined by impact energy, therefore, the dynamical numerical simulation for laminates could be carried out. Relation between the dent depth and the impact energy indicates that the variation of pit depth is consistent with the energy, and detailed analysis of damage distribution and size was conducted. The process of transverse low-speed impact of composite laminated plate was simulated by using finite element soft package ANSYS and method of transient analysis. C-scan was used to measure and to record the internal and external damages of laminated plate. Calculated and experimental results show that this method is feasible, especially is fit for the damage evaluation of composite laminated materials subjected to impact."

Our group and others have shown that in nitrogen limitation, and for a single species of Chlorella, a rise in culture medium pH yields triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation. To solidify and expand on these triggers, the influence\n and interaction of pH and nitrogen concentration on lipid production was further investigated on Chlorophyceae Scenedesmus sp. and Coelastrella sp. Growth was monitored optically and TAG accumulation was monitored by Nile red fluorescence and confirmed by gas chromatography.\n Both organisms grew in all treatments and TAG accumulation was observed by two distinct conditions: high pH and nitrogen limitation.\n The Scenedesmus sp. was shown to grow and produce lipids to a larger degree in alkaliphilic conditions (pH >9) and was used to further investigate\n the interplay between TAG accumulation from high pH and/or nitrate depletion. Results given here indicate that TAG accumulation\n per cell, monitored by Nile red fluorescence, correlates with pH at the time of nitrate depletion."

  "abstract": "Natural-orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) procedures have been tested using numerous approaches, mainly in animals. In humans, only cholecystectomy has been assessed, using a combined transvaginal and transumbilical approach. We present another variant of a hybrid technique for cholecystectomy, namely the combination of a flexible transumbilical double-channel endoscope and a 3-mm rigid transcutaneous trocar placed in the left hypochondrium for liver retraction.The procedure was attempted in 10 well-selected young patients (M : F = 4 : 6, mean age 29.5 years). Instruments used through the two working channels of the endoscope were either a grasping forceps or snare for grasping and pulling and a hot-biopsy forceps for cold and hot preparation and dissection. Endoclips were used for cystic duct and artery closure. Postoperative analgesia consisted of one intravenous dose of analgesic, followed by oral administration for one further day. Follow-up visits were scheduled at 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, and 6 months.In 4 of the 10 cases the operation had to be converted to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to difficulty in dissection (in 2 cases) or uncontrollable hemorrhage (2 cases). The mean operating time was 148 minutes. Of the 6 cases in which the procedure was finished by the new approach, cystic artery bleeding occurred in 1 and was successfully clipped. One further patient had a postoperative cystic duct leak with a bilioma, successfully treated by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stenting. Five of the six patients reported themselves as satisfied at 3- or 6-month follow-up.So far, our endoscope-based transumbilical cholecystectomy technique has not yielded satisfactory results in humans. Further instrument and accessory improvements may increase both success rate and acceptance. Scarless surgery without the inherent risks of a transluminal approach may then become feasible."

  "abstract": "Terpyridine-, diphenylbipyridine-, and triphenylpyridine-containing carboxylic acids were prepared, and the physical hydrogels formed from their sodium salts were studied. When terpyridine-containing carboxylic acids were dissolved by heating in aqueous NaOH solutions and then cooled, thermally-reversible transparent hydrogels were formed. The gelation ability was characterized by minimum gel concentrations. The structurally related diphenylbipyridine and triphenylpyridine-containing carboxylic acids failed to form hydrogels. Critical micelle concentrations (CMCs) of the sodium salts were determined according to emission spectra. Under an appropriate condition, terpyridine- and triphenylpyridine-containing carboxylic acids formed highly viscous fluids instead of hydrogels. The kinematic viscosity, determined with a Ubbelohde viscometer, increased with an increasing concentration of carboxylic acids. The increase in viscous fluids was associated with the formation of rod-like micelles. Transmission electron micrographs revealed numerous fibrous aggregates with diameters of several nanometers. The formation of hydrogels occurs on the following process: an increase in the concentration beyond CMCs brings about the transformation of spherical micelles to rod-like micelles, then the elongated rod-like micelles become juxtaposed and interlocked, which immobilizes the liquid."

  "abstract": "Proteolytic processing of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope (Env) precursor glycoprotein (gp160) to produce the mature gp120 and gp41 proteins is required for virus infection and virus-induced cell fusion. It has also been suggested that cleavage of gp120 at the immunodominant V3 loop region is required for virus-to-cell and cell-to-cell fusion. In this investigation we have studied the proteolytic processing of the HIV-1 Env in cells of various origins (human, monkey, and mouse) infected with a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing the entire gp160 protein (VV-env-1). We have observed that in murine Ltk(-) cells, in addition to the proteolytic cleavage of gp160 at the gp120/gp41 site, there is also extensive intracellular proteolytic processing of gp160 at the V3 loop and at a novel site located at the C terminus of gp41. Similar proteolytic processing of the Env precursor was observed after treatment of extracts of VV-env-1-infected monkey cells with thrombin, a trypsin-like protease that has been shown to cleave the gp120 at the V3 loop. Our findings suggest that murine Ltk(-) cells could be a good model system for structural studies of Env with different HIV isolates and in searches for proteinase inhibitors that could prevent HIV-1 infection of susceptible cells by blocking proteolysis of Env."

A special focus is on the concept of criminal responsibility.Information on legislation and practice concerning the assessment, placement and treatment of mentally ill offenders was gathered by means of a detailed, structured questionnaire which was filled in by national experts.The legal regulations relevant for forensic psychiatry in EU-member states are outlined. Definitions of mental disorders given within these acts are introduced and compared with ICD-10 diagnoses. Finally the application of the concept of criminal responsibility by the law and in routine practice is presented.Legal frameworks for the processing and placement of mentally disordered offenders varied markedly across EU-member states. Since May 2004 the European Union has expanded to 25 member states and in January 2007 it will reach 27. With increasing mobility across Europe, the need for increasing trans-national co-operation is becoming apparent in which great variation in legal tradition pertains."

  "abstract": "Angioedema (AE) associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) is a rare, but potentially life-threatening adverse reaction. Several studies have suggested that bradykinin (BK) is responsible for ACEi-induced AE, but the mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the metabolism of BK and des-Arg9-BK in the serum of 20 patients with a history of ACEi-associated AE and 21 control (C) subjects. Synthetic BK was incubated with the sera for various periods of time and residual BK and generated des-Arg9-BK were quantified by specific and sensitive enzyme immunoassays. No significant difference of half-life (t1/2) of both BK and des-Arg9-BK could be measured between C subjects and patients with AE (AE) in absence of ACEi. However, an analysis according to the prolonged (+) or not (-) t1/2 of des-Arg9-BK allowed a new stratification of C subjects and AE patients in four subgroups. The preincubation of sera with enalaprilat at a concentration inhibiting ACE significantly prevented the rapid degradation of BK and des-Arg9-BK in these four subgroups. In presence of ACEi, a subgroup (50%) of AE patients (AE + ) had a particularly significant rise of the t1/2 of des-Arg9-BK. Once ACE was inhibited, the concentration or the nature of the ACEi had no significant effect on the t1/2 of des-Arg9-BK. However, a test dilution of AE + sera with a control (C) serum showed that an enzyme defect rather than a circulating inhibitor could be responsible for the abnormal metabolism of des-Arg9-BK when ACE is inhibited. In conclusion, half of the patients with ACEi-associated AE present in serum had an enzyme defect involved in the des-Arg9-BK metabolism leading to its accumulation. The B1 agonist could be responsible, at least in part, for the local inflammatory reaction associated with the AE."

  "abstract": "Some individuals who engage in self-injurious behavior (SIB) also exhibit self-restraint. In the present study, a series of three functional analyses were conducted to determine the variables that maintained a participant's SIB, one without restraint items available, one with a preferred and effective form of self-restraint (an airplane pillow) available noncontingently, and one with this item delivered contingent on SIB. Results suggested that SIB was reinforced by escape and by access to self-restraint materials, self-restraint appeared to be maintained by automatic reinforcement, and continuous access to highly preferred restraint materials effectively suppressed SIB. DESCRIPTORS: self-injurious behavior, self-restraint, functional analysis"

  "abstract": "This paper presents a computational strategy proposal for optimise the physical arrangements of electrical power system overhead lines to increase the power transmission. The technique employs the Genetic Algorithms Theory to find the best geometric arrangement by weighting the optimal phase and sub-conductors spacing as well as the line heights. The target to be achieved is the maximum power at the receiver end. In order to emphasize the approach and the developed computational tool, the methodology is applied to typical 34.5 and 138 kV overhead lines."

Rigidity of the improved longitudinal beam decreased a little,but it still could meet with the design requirement."

In the follow-up left nephroblastoma and a right kidney simple cyst appeared. In the second patient, a thoracic\n tumor which proved to be a mature ganglioneuroma was discovered at age 4 years on a follow up spinal radiograph. Although\n less frequent than nephroblastoma and/or adrenal tumors, the occurrence of thoracic neuroblastoma in BWS suggests that periodic\n chest radiograph and assays of HVA, VMA and Dopamine should be included in the follow-up protocol."

Knowledge representation for the expert system is examined with particular emphasis on idiomatic control and its relationship to the goal tree—success tree knowledge structure. Execution of the expert system consists of elimination of poor control structures using rules and simple calculations and then proceeding to more intensive calculations terminating with tests using either shortcut dynamic models or detailed simulations if they are available. Efficiency, flexibility and requirements of the expert system are discussed as well as its use for education of control designers, process engineers, operators and students. The resulting expert system shell requirements are discussed."

  "abstract": "In the period 1990 - 2002, 1674 patients with colorectal carcinoma were operated in the First Surgical Clinic, Third Department for Colorectal Surgery. In 1264 cases (75.5%) rectal carcinoma was the indication for surgical treatment. Sphincter saving procedures (SSP) were performed in 824 (65.2%), abdominoperineal resections (APR) in 340 (26.9%) and resections of rectum with definitive stoma (Hartmann procedure) in 100 (7.9%) patients. We analyzed 1095 cases where curative SSP or APR were performed. All cases where curative resection was not possible because of liver metastases or inability to excise all macroscopic disease were excluded. In the group of patients where SSP was performed (767 cases), there were 26.6% high colorectal anastomoses (8cm from anal verge), 65.4% with low (4-8cm from anal verge) and 8.0% with intersphincteric coloanal anastomosis (cm from anal verge). Patohistological exam showed 5.3% Dukes A, 53.1% Dukes B, 36.5% Dukes C and 4.9% Dukes D. In the APR group (328 cases) there were 1.,5% Dukes A, 32.4% Dukes B, 62.1% Dukes C and 3.5% Dukes D. In this study we analyzed local recurrence and five-year survival in both groups. Recurrence of the disease was registered in 325 (29.6%) out of 1095 patients. Local recurrence was found in 81 (7.,4%) patients. In the SSP group recurrence occured in 215 (28.0%) out of 767 curative resections. Local recurrence alone was found in 53 patients (6.9%). SSP group was also divided into two subgroups; in the first group TME was performed and in second transection of mesorectum was carried out. Analyzing local recurrence in these two groups, in the TME group it was 7.6% and in the transection group 5.6%. In the APR group recurrence was registered in 110 (33.5%) out of 328 patients while local recurrence alone was found in 28 (8.5%) cases. Analyzing mortality we found that 234 (21.4%) out of 1095 patients died during follow-up. In the SSP group 154 out of 767 patients (20.1%) died. In the TME group mortality was 21.7% and in the transection group 16.9%. Mortality in the APR group showed that 80 out of 328 (24.4%) patients died during follow-up. Analysis by the Kaplan-Meier's test shows cumulative survival of 0.69 for all cases. In the SSP group cumulative survival is 0.72 and in the APR group 0.64 with statistically significant difference (p .001). In the TME group cumulative survival is 0.75 and in the transection group 0.,72 with statistically significant difference (p .05). We believe that performing SSP should be encouraged whenever it is possible because there is no difference in local recurrence rates and survival compared to APR. Transection of mesorectum can safely be performed in most cases with tumors located more than 8 cm form anal verge. We believe that exact preoperative staging and preoperative radiotherapy could improve results."

  "abstract": "We present the instrument package dedicated to spectroscopic studies of coronal flaring plasma composition. The package consists of two Bragg spectrometers, RESIK and DIOGENESS. These instruments will be launched aboard the Coronas-F solar observatory mid-2001. The relative abundance of certain elements (Ca) in flaring plasma heated to several million Kelvins (MK) is known to vary up to the factor of around 4 from flare to flare. Two spectrometers have capabilities of determining the absolute abundances of several important elements including low and high first ionization potential (FIP) ones. It will be possible to investigate fast temporal (∼ 1 min) changes of the plasma composition in flares and hotter active regions. This will lead to a better understanding of the processes causing elemental differentiation within the coronal plasma. The RESIK spectrometer was developed by a Consortium including NRL (USA), MSSL (UK), RAL (UK), IZMIRAN (Russia) and the Space Research Centre (SRC) of the Polish Academy of Sciences. DIOGENESS was developed in Poland and in the Astronomical Institute of the Czech Republic."

  "abstract": "We have studied the activity of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (rliuTNF) on six different human tumor xenografts derived from primary breast and bowel tumors and maintained by passage in nude mice. When 5 pg rHuTNF was given daily intratumorally to mice with established (approximately, 0.5 cm) tumors, total tumor regression was observed by 3-4 weeks in three of six xenograft lines. In a further two lines tumor stasis or significant slowing of growth was seen. This anti- tumor action was not accompanied by any consistent macroscopic change in the tumor such as necrosis, but histolÃ³gica!examination revealed tumor cell degeneration and a large peritumoral infiltration of host inflammatory cells after 4-7 days therapy. In contrast to these data, little effect was seen when the same dose of rHuTNF was administered i.p. to nude mice bearing these tumors. In only two of six lines was any significant slowing of tumor growth seen. A 5-fold increase in the i.p. dose resulted in improved activity on only one of two xenograft lines tested. Efficacy of the i.p. rHuTNF dose could, however, be enhanced by simultaneous administration of human Interferon, a or y. No obvious signs of toxicity were observed at all rHuTNF doses administered and weights of control and treated mice at the end of the experiments were comparable."

  "abstract": "Ultrastructural histochemical studies were performed using Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I lectin (UEA-I) and anti-endothelial monoclonal antibody BMA 120 in order to morphologically characterize the microvasculature of human colorectal carcinomas. In the normal mucosa, UEA-I and BMA 120 were bound to luminal plasma membrane of endothelial cells, usually continuously. Capillaries in the stroma of invasive adenocarcinomas showed remarkable structural changes such as swelling of endothelial cells with well-developed cell organelles and narrowing of the lumen. Reaction products for UEA-I and BMA 120 were both observed along the luminal plasma membrane of endothelial cells, usually discontinuously, partially retaining the features of normal capillaries. Furthermore, we have confirmed an occurrence of solid capillary buds composed of a strand of large endothelial cells with a trace of lumen. They showed almost no reactivity to UEA-I and BMA 120. Conventional electron microscopy revealed that they were present frequently in invasive carcinomas, but infrequently in intramucosal carcinomas and inflammatory lesions. Our results suggest that the stroma of invasive colorectal carcinomas abounds in immature capillaries and their precursors, which may indicate active tumor-induced angiogenesis."

  "abstract": "The present study was undertaken to evaluate long-term effects of spironolactone on basal serum oestrone, oestradiol, testosterone, LH and prolactin concentrations in hypertensive male patients. Serum prolactin response to TRH was also evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups: a conventional-dosage group, consisting of six males with essential hypertension who took 75 to 150 mg of spironolactone daily for 12 weeks, and a high-dosage group, consisting of two males with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism who took 300 mg of spironolactone daily for more than 40 weeks. In the conventional-dosage group, serum oestrone concentrations significantly increased (P less than 0.01) at 12 weeks, serum oestradiol concentrations gradually increased throughout the study period, however, the increments were not statistically significant (P less than 0.2). Basal serum testosterone, LH and prolactin concentrations were not significantly changed throughout the study period. Enhancement of serum prolactin response to TRH was not found in any of the patients in the conventional-dosage group. In the high-dosage group, serum oestrone maintained high levels from the beginning of this study, and serum oestradiol concentrations increased with the development of gynaecomastia. Serum testosterone, LH and prolactin concentrations did not show any definite change throughout the study period. Thus, long-term spironolactone treatment increased the serum levels of oestrone and oestradiol in hypertensive men followed by the development of gynaecomastia. The elevation in circulating oestrogens could well explain the oestrogenic side-effects of spironolactone treatment."

  "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the propagation effect of coculturing human stromal cells derived from umbilical cord blood with human AB type serum,and observe their biological behaviors. Methods Human stromal cells were isolated from the umbilical cord blood and inoculated into the DMEM/F12 media containing 15%human AB type serum,10.0μg/L bFGF and 10 ~6 mol/L hydrocortisone. The growth status was investigated under the inverted microscope,and the cytomorphological characteristics were observed by applying immunostaining assay.The cultured cells were identified with H-E staining and immunocytochemical staining assay.Results The human umbilical cord blood derived strom cells(hUCBDSCs) were isolated,and primary culture and serial subcultivation were conducted successfully.The hUCBDSCs demonstrated positive immunostaining for vimentin,CD34,negative immunostaining for TdT,CD45 and CK;which was in accordance with the character of human stromal cells.Conclusion The hUCBDSCs can be successfully cultured and propagated with human AB type serum in vitro,which provides a foundation for further study on the clinical application of hUCBDSCs."

  "abstract": "In this letter, we introduce a new system model for a multi-way communication where multiple users exchange information with each other by sharing an intermediate relay with multiple antennas. Particularly, we focus on the system where each user intends to send multiple unicast messages for dedicated users and a single multicast message for a group of users. We refer to this system as a K-user MIMO Y channel with heterogenous messages. For this channel, we propose a new cooperative beamforming method and study an achievable degree of freedom (DOF) using this scheme."

A special feature of the system is its use of syntax directed compilation techniques to process the various input languages. Through the use of incremental compilation, the system is able to offer extensibility of modules as well as extensibility of the entire system. A number of graphic output devices can be utilized. This system has been used to draw flowcharts of programs written in an ALGOL type language, FORTRAN, and a special flowcharting language and draw other diagrams composed of connecting blocks."

  "abstract": "We provide conclusive observational evidence demonstrating that a solar wind pressure pulse produces a twin-vortex system of ionospheric currents, while a step- wise pressure increase/decrease creates a single vortex struc- ture, at high-latitude ground magnetograms. Multi-satellite (Wind, Geotail, Interball, IMP 8 and GOES 8) and multi- instrument observations of plasma and magnetic field con- firm with in situ measurements that solar wind inherent pres- sure pulses and stepwise variations strike on the Earth's mag- netosphere in a global scale. The ground signatures are scrutinized in detail and the twin- or single-vortex current systems are studied using the IMAGE array stations. One more finding of this work is that a single vortex can produce monopolar and bipolar features, depending on the station position relative to the overhead travelling convection vor- tex (TCV). All of the above observational evidence confirms Glassmeier's (1992) prediction model that associates solar wind's steep changes of pressure with ionospheric TCVs."

  "abstract": "We present results from our Very Large Telescope large program to study the dynamical evolution of local Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs) and QSOs. Expanding previous studies by Genzel et al. (2001) and Tacconi et al. (2002), our data now consist of high resolution, long-slit H -a nd K-band spec- tra of 54 ULIRGs. This paper mainly presents the kinematics of sources that have coalesced into a single nucleus. The stellar kinematics, extracted from the CO rovibrational bandheads in our spectra, indicate that ULIRG remnants are dynamically heated systems with a mean dispersion of 157 km s 1 .T he com- bination of kinematic, structural, and photometric properties of the remnants indicate that they mostly originate from major encounters (in agreement with Dasyra et al. 2006) and that they result in the formation of dispersion-supported systems (elliptical galaxies of the order1010-1011M). Placing ULIRGs on the fundamental plane of early-type galaxies indicates that the end products of ultra- luminous mergers are typically less massive and extended than giant ellipticals (in good agreement with Genzel et al. 2001 and Tacconi et al. 2002). Convert- ing the host dispersion into black hole mass with the aid of the MBH relation yields black hole mass estimates of the order 107 -1 0 8 M and high accretion"

  "abstract": "Akt signaling pathway has attracted much attention as a promising target for cancer therapeutics. Herein, we report that Isobavachalcone (IBC), a natural chalcone, potently abrogates Akt signaling and exerts anti-proliferative effects on several human cancer cell lines. Modeling results from the Sybyl/FlexiDock program suggest that IBC potentially binds to the ATP-binding pocket of Akt, which is confirmed by the observations that IBC inhibits Akt1 kinase in vitro. Further studies reveal that IBC significantly abates Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Akt kinase activity in cells, which subsequently leads to inhibition of Akt downstream substrates and evokes significant levels of apoptosis associated with mitochondria pathway."

An individual red blood cell (RBC) has a scattering phase function strongly peaked in the forward direction. For far-field experiments, the small scattering volumes can be considered as \"macroscopic particles\" characterized by an effective scattering phase function. Using the single-cell phase function as \"input data\" the angular distribution of light scattered at small angles by the whole scattering volume, containing RBCs in suspension, is calculated analytically. The angular dispersion of the light scattered by blood can be approximately described by the same formula used to characterize the light scattered by a single cell but with an effective, hematocrit-dependent anisotropy parameter."

  "abstract": "Dendritic growth is a nonlinear process, which falls into the category of self-organizing pattern formation phenomena. It is of great practical importance, since it appears frequently and, in the case of alloys, affects the engineering properties of the resulting solid. We describe a new finite element algorithm for the two–dimensional Stefan problem, where the free boundary is represented as a level set. This allows to handle topological changes of the free boundary. The accuracy of the method is verified and several numerical simulations, including topological changes of the free boundary, are presented."

METHODS: Differentiation induction of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line BEL-7402 was carried out with liver tissue extracts from an animal model of liver injury. The changes of cell biological characteristics,such as morphological features of the cells,MTT growth curves and cell cycle distribution,were dynamically observed. RESULTS: After exposed to the tissue extracts of injured liver,the number of mitotic cells was decreased,and the speed of growth and the proliferation of carcinoma cells were slowed down dramatically. The percentage of the cells in G0/G1 phase was increased,while the cells in S phase was decreased. The level of proliferation index (PI) also declined. CONCLUSION: The tissue extracts of injured liver affect the differentiation status of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line BEL-7402,promote the cell differentiation and reduce the tumor characteristics. The tissue extracts of injured liver possess an important potential as a tumor differentiation inducer."

  "abstract": "Temperature programmed hydrogen reduction studies have been carried out for SnO2 and Ce-Sn mixed oxides with and without Pd metal impregnation, to demonstrate the existence of spillover of hydrogen from Pd metal centers to support oxides. TPR pattern of SnO2 showed a main peak at ~973 K indicating the bulk reduction of this sample. In Pd metal impregnated sample, the bulk reduction peak shifts to lower temperature (~923 K) due to the spillover of activated hydrogen from Pd metal to SnO2 at relatively lower temperatures and its subsequent reaction with SnO2. For Pd impregnated Ce-Sn mixed oxide samples also, a similar effect or an enhanced reduction was observed indicating the spillover effect of hydrogen. These results have been further confirmed from 119Sn Mössbauer spectroscopic measurements carried out for some representative samples of SnO2 and Pd/SnO2 heated in hydrogen flow up to a temperature of 473 K. The value of Sn2+/(Sn4++Sn2+) ratio was found to be significantly higher for Pd impregnated sample. Both these observations provide direct evidence for the existence of spillover effect of hydrogen taking place in the metal impregnated samples."

The genesis is an indicator for the weather, geomorphology and the local geography latitude, and indirectly to the continental derive, regional tectonic and eustatic variation of the level of sea during the Phanerozoic, each of these times is related to the Peruvian tectonic development and mainly with the continental derive and the lineaments with the plate tectonics. The main causes of genesis of Peruvian basin coals were during each formation time, different, been all these basin subparallel to the continental ridge that was originally Gondwana and it belongs actually to South America, that is why the coal basins give an integral vision of the Peruvian geology in the Global Geotectonic."

  "abstract": "This paper presents an efficient scheme for dynamic replication of data in distributed environments. The aim of the scheme is to increase system performance by intelligent data placement so as to optimize the message traffic in the network. Research in the recent past has comparatively focussed very little on using replication for increasing performance but has instead been directed more at improving system availability through replication. However, with the advent of mobile or nomadic computing, research in replication needs to change direction-- the underlying assumption of high speed networks no longer hold true. Wireless networks not only have lower bandwidth but are also very expensive to use. In such an environment, it is imperative that data be distributed intelligently to achieve a good system performance in terms of message costs and turnaround time. Besides, with mobility introduced in the system, earlier static schemes for improving performance (e.g., the File Allocation Problem) are no longer applicable. As a first step, we propose a totally distributed dynamic replication scheme, which uses a finite automaton based technique to learn access patterns. This accrued information is then used to predict future access sequences and dynamically reorder-- replicate or delete copies of data in the network, in anticipation of predicted accesses, to reduce network message costs. Being distributed, each node of the network bases its decision to replicate or delete an existing copy solely on local information. Our algorithm is also integrated and corrects some of the drawbacks of earlier theoretical work in this area. Finally, we present some preliminary simulation results which show that our scheme is very promising."

  "abstract": "A simple colorimetric method for the differentiation of indoleacetic acid (IAA) and indolebutyric acid (IBA) in plant samples is described. The color change is based upon the reaction between the auxins and p-(dimethylamino)benzaldehyde (PDAB, Ehrlich reagent) following the electrophilic substitution reaction mechanism at the indole ring. Using their different response to reaction temperature and time, the selective determination of IBA in the presence of IAA is achieved by controlling the incubation time of 40 min at 25 degrees C. The total absorbance of IAA and IBA is determined after they react to PDAB for 150 min at 70 degrees C. The concentration of IAA can then be calculated using the difference between their total absorbance and the calculated absorbance of IBA. The detection limits (3sigma) of IAA and IBA were 0.10 microM and 0.28 microM, respectively. The precisions for five replicate measurements of 10 microM IAA and IBA were less than 5% (RSD). The recovery from mung bean sprout samples varied from 87.5% to 108% for the two auxins. Moreover, the Ehrlich reaction conditions are compatible with the methanol-hydrochloric acid extraction procedure. All of the above results indicate that this protocol provides a rapid, simple, convenient and practical method for detection and differentiation of IAA and IBA. From the color changes of IAA and IBA after Ehrlich reaction, the identification of auxin at the microM level can be achieved even with the naked eye. The method was successfully used to investigate the auxin changes of mung bean sprout during the growth procedure."

  "abstract": "Elastic constants of tetragonal system DyB 2 C 2 with antiferro-quadrupole (AFQ) ordering have been measured by using ultrasonic method. Remarkable elastic softenings of the C 44 and ( C 11 − C 12 )/2 have been observed towards the AFQ transition at T Q =25 K . The present results show that a CEF ground state is a pseudo-quartet consisting of two Kramers doublets of E 1/2 and E 3/2 in C 4h site symmetry of Dy 3+ ion. The dominant softening of C 44 probably leads to the order parameter of O yz and O zx in AFQ phase. Magnetic phase diagram applied fields along the [1 0 0] direction determined by field dependence of the C 44 is presented. Keywords Antiferro-quadrupole ordering Elastic constant DyB 2 C 2 Recently, rare-earth compounds DyB 2 C 2 and HoB 2 C 2 have attracted much interest because of the first showing antiferro-quadrupole (AFQ) orderings in tetragonal lattice [1,2] . DyB 2 C 2 undergoes to the AFQ phase II at T Q =25 K and succesively to antiferro-magnetic (AFM) phase III at T N =15 K . In the case of HoB 2 C 2 , it has been found the AFQ phase II, AFM phase III and IV. The phase IV that appears between paramagnetic phase I and AFM phase III coexisting with AFQ is characterized by a considerable elastic softening and enhancement of ultrasonic attenuation of C 44 [3] . Resonant X-ray scattering has succeeded in showing the presence of the AFQ ordering in DyB 2 C 2 and HoB 2 C 2 [4,5] . However, the order parameter of the AFQ phase has not been identified yet for both cases. Furthermore, energy level scheme in the tetragonal crystalline electric field (CEF) potential has not been determined by inelastic neutron scattering. In this paper, we present the results of the ultrasonic experiments on single crystals of DyB 2 C 2 . The AFQ order parameter and CEF ground state in DyB 2 C 2 are argued. Fig. 1 shows temperature dependence of the elastic constants C 66 , C 44 and ( C 11 − C 12 )/2 for transverse waves in DyB 2 C 2 . Clear anomalies have been observed at the AFQ transition at T Q =25 K and AFM one at T N =15 K . It should be noted that remarkable softening of the C 44 and ( C 11 − C 12 )/2 towards T Q that is responsible for orbital degeneracy of the CEF ground state. On the other hand, the C 66 increases monotonously with decreasing temperature down to T Q . Hund's rule multiplet J= 15 2 of Dy 3+ splits into four E 1/2 and four E 3/2 Kramers doublets in the tetragonal C 4h site symmetry. Taking into account a pseudo quartet state predicted by specific heat showing release entropy of R ln 4 [1] , we propose a model consisting of accidentally degenerated two Kramers doublets of E 1/2 and E 3/2 that leads to the softening of C 44 and ( C 11 − C 12 )/2 for the CEF ground state. The elastic softenings of C 44 associated with the quadrupole O yz , O zx and ( C 11 − C 12 )/2 with O 2 2 are described by an equation of C Γ ( T )= C Γ 0 ( T − T c 0 )/( T − Θ ) deduced from the quadrupole-strain susceptibility. Furthermore, the dominant elastic softening of C 44 probably leads to the order parameter of the AFQ phase II to be O yz and O zx . Results shown in Fig. 2 is the C 44 in various fixed magnetic fields along the [1 0 0] direction. The data below 2 T show the succesive transitions from the paramagnetic phase I through AFQ phase II to AFM phase III as the temperature is lowered. However, the II–III phase boundary becomes obscure above 2 T up to 6 T . The results above 10 T indicate no sign of phase transition. In the middle of magnetic fields at 7.5 and 8 T , several anomalies, that probably associated with transitions to a subphase III′ of the AFM III and reentrance to the AFQ II, have been observed. Another important finding is that the softening still remains up to 12 T at higher temperatures, which suggests the quadrupole O yz and O zx plays a key role even in high fields. The magnetic phase diagram of DyB 2 C 2 under fields along the [1 0 0] direction is plotted in Fig. 3 . Solid triangles and squares are determined by the present ultrasonic experiments and open circles are obtained from the magnetic susceptibility by Yamauchi et al. Plotted data obtained from the present study is roughly consistent with the previous results [1] . However, the I–II phase boundary may close around 8 T indicated by a broken line obtained from the results of the field dependence of C 44 that shows upturn anomaly (not shown). For optimum results of anisotropy of the AFQ and AFM interaction, ultrasonic measurements for several elastic constants in magnetic fields along the three principal axes are now in progress.

  "abstract": "A number of reflexes and amphetamine-induced locomotor and stereotyped behavior were assesses in 8, 16, 32, 90 and 360 day old C57BL/6J and SEC/1ReJ inbred mice. The data indicate that C57 mice are more precocious for a number of neuronal and behavioral mechanisms while SEC mice are less mature at birth. In addition, there are appreciable fluctuations of these behavioral patterns throughout life. A rise in arousal levels was evident in both strains between 8 and 16 days and between 32 and 90 days of age. Three-hundred-sixty days old mice presented a general decrease in the levels of arousal. These findings are discussed in terms of neuronal and behavioral plasticity and in relation to the ontogeny of the different catecholaminergic systems which modulate excitory and inhibitory different behavioral patterns at different ages."

  "abstract": "The relation between CaM kinase II activity and high Ca2+-mediated stress responses was studied in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. Treatment with ionomycin (1 µM) for 5 min caused a significant loss of CaM kinase II activity in whole cell homegenates and prominent vesiculation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Similar losses of CaM kinase II activity were observed in the soluble lysate as assessed by activity measurements and Western blotting. Examination of the post-lysate particulate fraction showed that the loss of CaM kinase II from the soluble lysate was accompanied by a redistribution of CaM kinase II to this fraction. The ionomycin-mediated response was limited to this concentration (1 µM); lower concentrations of ionomycin as well as stimulation with angiotensin II (1 µM) or ATP (100 µM) did not cause a shift in CaM kinase II distribution. Treatment with neither the CaM kinase II inhibitor KN-93 nor the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid altered the ionomycin-induced redistribution indicating that CaM kinase II activation and/or phosphorylation was not part of the mechanism. The response, however, was eliminated when the cells were treated in Ca2+-free medium. Washout of ionomycin led to only a partial restoration of the kinase activity in the soluble fraction after 10 min. Immunofluorescence microscopy of resting cells indicated colocalization of antibodies to CaM kinase II and an ER protein marker. ER vesiculation induced by ionomycin coincided with a parallel redistribution of CaM kinase II and ER marker proteins. These data link ionomycin-induced ER restructuring to a progressive redistribution of CaM kinase II protein to an insoluble particulate fraction and loss of cellular CaM kinase II activity. We propose that redistribution of CaM kinase II and loss of cellular activity are components of a common Ca2+-overload induced cellular stress response in cells."

  "abstract": "Pulsed laser photoexcitation studies of the system pyrene and diethyl aniline have been carried out in an acetonitriletoluene mixed solvent system of varying composition. The photo-processes occuring over the first few nanoseconds have been observed which show that the amine induces the pyrene * (S 1 ) to undergo efficient intersystem crossing, and that this process is the only one which produces any pyrene * (T 1 ) in the first 40 ns after excitation. Subsequent changes depend on the solvent composition. In neat toluene no further pyrene * (T 1 ) is formed: inthe presence of CH 3 CN, additional pyrene * (T 1 ) arises in a process which is thought to be dissociation of a triplet exciplex with a neutral lifetime of 47 ns. A mechanism for the triplet exciplex formation is discussed in terms of geminate ion separation and recombination."

Paradoxically, those civil wars which are prolonged and therefore do most damage create only small instant peace dividends. Income has fallen because capital has been lost and so cannot recover until capital has been reaccumulated. However, some of the capital losses are reverable. Once confidence in a secure environment is restored there is a delayed peace dividend as private capital is repatriated andsocial capital' is rebuilt. Post- war governments should therefore focus not upon how to spend an illusory early dividend, but on how to restore private confidence."

So far, HIV Env-derived immunogens have not been able to elicit broad neutralizing antibody responses against primary isolates. Identifying conditions that will permit the efficient production of different soluble HIV Env proteins will facilitate a high throughput comparative analysis of the immunogenicity of diverse Env constructs, potentially identifying Env forms that are more conducive to the elicitation of anti-HIV NAbs. Here we compared different cell types, transfection reagents, transfection conditions and different DNA expression vectors on soluble HIV Envelope expression levels. We identified optimal expression conditions and developed a protocol to streamline and maximize production of diverse HIV Env constructs. Using this optimized platform, milligram quantities of purified soluble HIV Env trimer can be routinely achieved in a rapid and cost-effective manner."

They were randomly assigned to receive BP (n=68) or MP (n=63). The primary endpoint was the time to treatment failure (TTF). Secondary endpoints included survival, remission rate, toxicity and quality of life.The overall response rate was 75% in the BP and 70% in the MP group. A significantly higher number of patients treated with BP achieved a complete remission than did patients receiving MP (32 vs. 13%; P=0.007), and the maximum response was achieved more rapidly in patients treated with BP compared to those receiving MP (6.8 vs. 8.7 cycles; P<0.02). TTF and remission duration were significantly longer in the BP group. Patients receiving BP had higher QoL scores and reported pain less frequently than patients receiving MP.BP is superior to MP with respect to complete remission rate, TTF, cycles needed to achieve maximum remission and quality of life and should be considered the new standard in first-line treatment of MM patients not eligible for transplantation."

  "abstract": "An experiment on stimulus compounding was conducted using 5th- and 6th-grade students as Ss. On each of a series of 960 discrete trials, S was presented with 1 of 3 stimuli, s-sub(1), s-sub(2), or s-sub(3), or with a compound of these stimuli, (s-sub(1) + s-sub(2)), (s-sub(1) + s-sub(3)), (s-sub(2) + s-sub(3)) or (s-sub(1) + s-sub(2) + s-sub(3)). The S responded to each stimulus presentation by selecting 1 of 2 response keys, A-sub(1) or A-sub(2). If π-sub(i) is the probability that A-sub(1) is reinforced when s-sub(i) is presented then π-sub(i) = 1.0 and π-sub(2) = .33 for all Ss. 3 experimental groups were differentiated by π-sub(3) which took the values .25, .50, and .75. No reinforcement event followed the presentation of a compound. 3 models are described that generate predictions for response probabilities to a compound stimulus in terms of response probabilities to the component stimuli. Model I postulates a simple averaging rule. Model II assumes that the influence of each component stimulus is proportional to the likelihood that it elicits a correct response. Model III assumes that the response to the compound is determined solely by the one component that is most frequently reinforced. It was found that Model II gave the best account of these data.

  "abstract": "The natural history of recovery from brain injury typically consists of a period of impaired consciousness, a subsequent period of confusion and amnesia, followed by a period of post-confusional recovery of function. Patients with more severe injuries may have more prolonged episodes of unconsciousness or minimal consciousness and may not fully evolve through this continuum of recovery. There is limited information on the course of recovery and long-term outcome of patients with prolonged unconsciousness, particularly those with extended periods in the minimally conscious state. Further, patients with impaired consciousness are frequently denied access to hospital-based rehabilitation services because of uncertain prognosis and a perceived lack of benefit from rehabilitative interventions. Methods: A consecutive series of 36 patients with traumatic (TBI) and non-traumatic brain injury (nonTBI) in a vegetative state (VS) or minimally conscious state (MCS) on admission to a specialized, slow-to-recover brain injury program in an acute rehabilitation hospital was retrospectively reviewed to evaluate course of recovery during rehabilitation hospitalization and in follow-up, 1–4 years post-injury. Independent variables included: time to resolution of VS, MCS and confusional state/posttraumatic amnesia (CS/PTA), based on Aspen criteria, Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) and Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT) scores. Outcome measures (calculated separately for TBI, nonTBI, VS, or MCS on admission subgroups) included: proportion of patients who recover and recovery time to MCS, CS/PTA stages, household independence, and return to school or work, as well as Disability Rating Scale (DRS) scores at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years post-injury. Results: The majority emerged from MCS (72%) and CS/PTA (58%) by latest follow-up. It took significantly longer for patients admitted in VS (means: MCS, 16.43 weeks; CS/PTA, 30.1 weeks) than MCS (means: MCS, 7.36 weeks; CS/PTA, 11.5 weeks) to reach both milestones. Almost all who failed to clear CS/PTA by latest follow-up were patients with nonTBI or TBI with VS lasting over 8 weeks. Duration of MCS was a strong predictor of duration CS/PTA after emergence from MCS, accounting for 57% of the variance. Nearly half the patients followed at least 1 year achieved recovery to, at least, daytime independence at home and 22% returned to work or school, 17% at or near pre-injury levels. Discharge FIM score or duration of MCS, along with age, were best predictors of DRS in outcome models. DRS scores continued to improve after 2 and 3 years post-injury. Conclusions: Patients in VS whose transition to MCS occurred within 8 weeks of onset are likely to continue recovering to higher levels of functioning, a substantial proportion to household independence, and productive pursuits. Patients with TBI are more likely to progress than patients with nonTBI, though significant improvement in the nonTBI group is still possible. Active, higher intensity, rehabilitation should be strongly considered for patients with severely impaired consciousness after brain injury, especially for patients with TBI who have signs of progression to the MCS."

When all backgrounds within a block of trials are of the same type, appropriate adjustments of response criteria can be\n made to accommodate the irrelevant evidence and thus maintain acceptable levels of accuracy. However, when backgrounds of\n different types are mixed randomly, compromise criteria are adopted. This compromise-criteria account predicts distinctive\n interaction patterns for reaction times when blocked versus mixed presentations of various background types are compared.\n The predicted interactions were obtained for asymmetric- and no-noise backgrounds in Experiment 1 and forsymmetric-, asymmetric-, and no-noise backgrounds in Experiment 2. The findings support the general view that extraneous display attributes are weighted\n into the evidence for same anddifferent, with criteria settings used that minimize errors under the noisiest conditions."

  "abstract": "Analyses of immunoglobulin (Ig) variable (V) region gene usage in the immune response, estimates ofV gene germline complexity, and other nucleic acid hybridization-based studies depend on the extent to which such genes are\n related (i. e., sequence similarity) and their organization in gene families. While mouseIgh heavy chainV region (V\n \n H\n ) gene families are relatively well-established, a corresponding systematic classification ofIgk light chainV region (V\n \n k\n ) genes has not been reported. The present analysis, in the course of which we reviewed the known extent of theV\n \n k\n  germline gene repertoire andV\n \n k\n  gene usage in a variety of responses to foreign and self antigens, provides a classification of mouseV\n \n k\n  genes in gene families composed of members with >80% overall nucleic acid sequence similarity. This classification differed\n in several aspects from that ofV\n \n H\n  genes: only someV\n \n k\n  gene families were as clearly separated (by >25% sequence dissimilarity) as typicalV\n \n H\n  gene families; mostV\n \n k\n  gene families were closely related and, in several instances, members from different families were very similar (>80%) over\n large sequence portions; frequently, classification by nucleic acid sequence similarity diverged from existing classifications\n based on amino-terminal protein sequence similarity. Our data have implications forV\n \n k\n  gene analyses by nucleic acid hybridization and describe potentially important differences in sequence organization betweenV\n \n H\n  andV\n \n k\n  genes."

ED has serious adverse effects on the sexual experience of female partners, while the attitudes of female partners to ED will have a direct effect on seeking and continuing treatment behavior of ED patients. So it's necessary for clinicians to consider female partners in the clinical practice of ED. The evidence from a recently published clinical trial has demonstrated that vardenafil not only improved ED men's erectile function, but also improved the sexual quality of life for female partners, which was the ideal solution of ED couples."

  "abstract": "Objective: The enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence-polymerase chain reaction(ERIC-PCR) and repetitive extragenic palindromic element-polymerase chain reaction(REP-PCR) were used to analyze the types of 88 Vibrio parahaemolyticus including 2 standard strains,13 laboratory strains and 73 isolated strains.Methods: REP and ERIC primers were used to amplify the repeated sequences.NTsys-pc software was used to calculate the discriminative index of REP-and ERIC-PCR with Dice coefficients.Results: All 88 tested V.parahamolyticus could be typed by REP-and ERICPCR clearly and revealed abundant genetic diversity in V.parahamolyticus.According to the results of REP-PCR-amplified 5–9 bands within 609–4200 bp,V.parahamolyticus was typed into 5 groups and 12 types with discrimination index of 0.93,and the tdh+ strains with resolving index of 0.86 could be classified in Group I.According to ERIC-PCR-amplified 5–11 bands within 400–7593 bp,V.parahamolyticus was typed into 7 groups and 11 types with discrimination index of 0.94,and the tdh+ strains with discrimination index of 0.76 could be classified in group I.Conclusion: The isolated tdh+ strains are clustered together with standard strains using the two methods.Although both methods exhibit good typing capability,REPPCR is more repeatable and stable than ERIC-PCR."

  "abstract": "In 12 patients with nephrocalcinosis, radiographs were compared with computed tomography, sonography and histology. Computed tomography detects nephrocalcinosis at a very early stage of the disease, gives a better picture of the density and extent of nephrocalcinosis and may detect other findings (e. g. cysts). Radiographs may show many more details than computed tomography; they seem to be more suitable for observing the course of the disease and have a lower radiation dose. Sonography has not been helpful in the diagnosis of nephrocalcinosis. Histology correlates only moderately with the degree of nephrocalcinosis demonstrated in radiographs and computed tomography."

  "abstract": "This paper describes our experience implementing CES, a distributed Collaborative Editing System written in Argus, a language that includes facilities for managing long-lived distributed data. Argus provides atomic actions, which simplify the handling of concurrency and failures, and mechanisms for implementing atomic data types, which ensure serializability and recoverability of actions that use them. This paper focuses on the support for atomicity in Argus, especially the support for building new atomic types. Overall the mechanisms in Argus made it relatively easy to build CES; however, we encountered interesting problems in several areas. For example, much of the processing of an atomic action in Argus is handled automatically by the run-time system; several examples are presented that illustrate areas where more explicit control in the implementations of atomic types would be useful."

On the other hand, oral contraceptive\n (Norminest tablets) decreased significantly follicle stimulating hormone serum level, while combined administration of calcium\n gluconate and oral contraceptive caused significant increase of serum level of follicle stimulating hormone compared with\n control values.

We show that debt limits, equity issuing costs, and foreign direct investment search costs generate a financing premium and that the \"cheapest\" source of financing depends on the phase of the business cycle and past financing decisions. The model delivers several results that are consistent with stylized facts observed in emerging markets. First, as the cost of each financing instrument changes, the demand for foreign debt, portfolio equity, and foreign direct investment adjusts thereby explaining fluctuations in the composition of the capital account over the business cycle. Second, the financial frictions generate a countercyclical financing premium which is consistent with countercyclical interest rates and a countercyclical current account."

  "abstract": "Objective:To analyze the sites,pathogens,and prognosis of nosecomial infections in patients with severe viral hepatitis(SVH), and explore the efficient measures to decrease nosocomial infections. Methods:Two hundred and eighty one hospitalized cases of SVH were investigated and analyzed retrespectively,through comparing fatality rate between the infected group and the taintless group. Results: In 281 cases of SVH,there were 120 cases complicated by infection. The total rate of infection was 42.7%. In these infected case,there were 4 patients with acute severe viral hepatitis,39 patients with sub-acute severe viral hepatitis and 77 ones with chronic severe viral hepatitis,with each of the respective infection rate of 21.1% (4/9),38.2% (39/102)and 48.1% (77/160). Abdominal cavity infection was the most usual and accounted for 40.3%;in addition to it,the infection sites included gastrointestinal tract,oral cavity and lower respiratory tract in order. In the infected group,61 patients died with 50.8% of mortality,while in 161 case without infection,40 patients died with 24% of mortality. Conclusion: Date presented indicated that efficient prevention and active treatment with nesocomial infections is vital for increasing of cure rate and decreasing of mortality"

  "abstract": "The literature concerning the application of information-feedback methods for saving energy in the home is reviewed. Particular attention is given to electronic feedback via smart meters and displays, or “energy-consumption indicators” (ECI). Previous studies have not focused on individual appliances, but this paper presents the findings of a UK field study involving 44 households which considered domestic cooking: it compares the effectiveness of providing paper-based energy-use/saving information with electronic feedback of energy-consumption via ECIs designed specifically for this investigation. Twelve Control Group households were monitored for a period of at least 12 months and this revealed an average daily consumption for electric cooking of 1.30 kWh. Subsequently across a minimum monitoring period of 2 months, 14 out of 31 households achieved energy savings of greater than 10% and six of these achieved savings of greater than 20%. The average reduction for households employing an ECI was 15%, whereas those given antecedent information alone reduced their electricity consumption, on average, by only 3%. The associated behavioural changes and the importance of providing regular feedback during use are identified. It is recommended that further attention be given to optimising the design and assessing the use of energy-consumption indicators in the home, in order to maximise the associated energy-saving potential."

  "abstract": "TSH secretion, with particular regard to the nocturnal surge of the hormone, was evaluated in 15 women (age range, 35-66 yr; mean, 50 yr) with untreated major endogenous depression and 15 healthy women (age range, 32-67 yr; mean, 53 yr) using an ultrasensitive assay. Mean morning (0830 h) TSH values did not differ in the 2 groups (1.3 +/- 02 mU/L in depressives and 1.4 +/- 0.1 mU/L in controls), whereas mean nighttime (2400-0200 h) values were significantly reduced in depressives (1.5 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.3 mU/L; P less than 0.0005). At variance with the control group, morning and nighttime TSH values did not differ in the depressives. The nocturnal serum TSH surge was abolished in 14 of 15 depressed patients. The mean peak TSH value after TRH was slightly yet significantly lower in the depressives. Patients with subnormal (less than 0.4 mU/L) TSH values in the morning had a serum TSH increase after TRH less than 2 mU/L in 5 of 6 cases and a lack of the nocturnal TSH surge in 6 of 6. Among the 9 patients with normal TSH values in the morning, the nocturnal serum TSH surge was lost in 8 of 9, whereas the response to TRH was normal in all. The depressives, at variance with other reports, showed significantly lower values of total and free thyroid hormones. Mean serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and ferritin were also significantly reduced. In conclusion, major endogenous depression is associated with a major impairment of TSH secretion, which baseline TSH measurements in the morning and the evaluation of the TSH response to TRH may not reveal. In this regard, the loss of the nocturnal serum TSH rise would appear to be a more sensitive indicator of hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis alterations in depressives than the TRH test, which is commonly used in the evaluation of these patients. The lack of the nocturnal TSH surge may be responsible for the reduced thyroid hormone secretion and supports the case for some degree of central hypothyroidism in endogenous depression."

  "abstract": "Many malwares we encounter these days are armed with its own custom encoding methods (i.e., they are packed) to make security/reverse analysis difficult or impossible. Dealing with large volumes of malware samples, building general unpacking framework is important to lift the burden of manual post processing. In this paper, we present our preliminary efforts toward generic binary unpacking. Our architecture includes a concept of shadow states to observe the encoding/decoding activities of stub code in a packed malware and quantify the revealed code resulted from those activities to spot candidate original entry points automatically. We show our proof-of- concept implementation of the proposed method with dynamic binary instrumentation technique. We confirmed the effectiveness of our method with the experimental results conducted on some widely deployed packers and also identified its limitation.

The sample solution of metal chelates dissolved in organic solvent was injected with a microsyringe into the carrier gas containing the ligand vapour in order to prevent the decomposition of the chelates. With this method, calibration curves of five metals such as Al, Be, Cr, Cu and Fe, whose linear range is over three orders of magnitude, were obtained after optimization of operating conditions. Sub-nanogram amounts of metal chelates in microliter samples could be determined with a relative standard deviation of a few percent."

Studies of the mechanism underlying the poor augmentation revealed that neither enzymatically deacylated LPS from Escherichia coli J5 (J5 dLPS) nor yersinia LPS-OH stimulated expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules E-selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, whereas both intact J5 LPS and yersinia LPS were stimulatory. Impaired up-regulation could not be explained by decreased binding of yersinia LPS-OH to HUVECs. Furthermore, 51Cr-labelled HUVECs treated with different concentrations of yersinia LPS-OH released 51Cr in the presence of anti-yersinia anti-O antibody and complement. J5 dLPS and yersinia LPS-OH inhibited up-regulation of the adhesion molecules induced by J5 LPS and yersinia LPS but not that induced by tumour necrosis factor alpha. Taken together, the results suggest that although yersinia LPS-OH can depress development of acute inflammation by inhibiting up-regulation of endothelial-cell adhesion molecules, sufficient LPS-OH is bound to induce cell injury and thereby inflammation in the presence of specific antibody and complement. The findings may have pathogenetic implications in yersinia-triggered reactive arthritis characterized by dissemination of yersinia LPS throughout the body."

  "abstract": "The ability of different polyamines to catalyze hydrolysis of phosphodiester linkages in apurinic and apyrimidinic (AP) sites has been investigated in supercoiled, relaxed and denatured DNA, and also in core and chromatosome particles. The rate constants for the hydrolysis in the DNAs have been determined. In general the order of effectiveness of the polyamines were: spermine greater than spermidine greater than putrescine greater than cadaverine. A 9 fold difference in rate constants was found between spermine and cadaverine. No difference in the rate of hydrolysis was seen between AP-sites in supercoiled and relaxed DNAs, whereas the rate for the single-stranded DNA and DNA in core and chromatosome particles was only half of that in the double-stranded DNA. All AP-sites in both free DNA and DNA-histone particles were hydrolyzed in the presence of polyamines. For all polyamines, with the exception of spermine, increasing concentration of both Mg++ and salts such as KCl both led to a large decrease in the rate of polyamine-induced hydrolysis of AP-sites. The rate of hydrolysis increased markedly with increasing pH in the pH range pH 6 - pH 11."

This model permits an easy implementation in shared memory, while still being able to benefit from performance advantages of message-passing for performance critical tasks. We have integrated message-passing with a software DSM system, and evaluated the programming effort and performance with three different applications and various degree of message-passing in the applications.In two of the applications we found that only a small fraction of the source code lines responsible for interprocess communication were performance critical and it was therefore easy to convert only those to message-passing primitives and still approach the performance of pure message-passing."

  "abstract": "Impaired nitric oxide (NO)-dependent vasorelaxation plays a key role in the development of diabetic vascular complications. We investigated the effect of hyperglycaemia on impaired vasoreactivity and a putative role therein of the AGE precursor methylglyoxal.The effects of high glucose and methylglyoxal on NO-dependent vasorelaxation in isolated rat mesenteric arteries from wild-type and transgenic glyoxalase (GLO)-I (also known as GLO1) rats, i.e. the enzyme detoxifying methylglyoxal, were recorded in a wire myograph. AGE formation of the major methylglyoxal-adduct 5-hydro-5-methylimidazolone (MG-H1) was detected with an antibody against MG-H1 and quantified with ultra-performance liquid chromatography (tandem) mass spectrometry. Reactive oxygen species formation was measured with a 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2'7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate acetyl ester probe and by immunohistochemistry with an antibody against nitrotyrosine.High glucose and methylglyoxal exposure of mesenteric arteries significantly reduced the efficacy of NO-dependent vasorelaxation (p < 0.05). This impairment was not observed in mesenteric arteries of GLO-I transgenic rats indicating a specific intracellular methylglyoxal effect. The diabetes-induced impaired potency (pD(2)) in mesenteric arteries of wild-type rats was significantly improved by GLO-I overexpression (p < 0.05). Methylglyoxal-modified albumin did not affect NO-dependent vasorelaxation, while under the same conditions the receptor for AGE ligand S100b did (p < 0.05). Methylglyoxal treatment of arteries increased intracellular staining of MG-H1 in endothelial cells and adventitia by fivefold accompanied by an eightfold increase in the oxidative stress marker nitrotyrosine. Antioxidant pre-incubation prevented methylglyoxal-induced impairment of vasoreactivity.These data show that hyperglycaemia-induced impairment of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation is mediated by increased intracellular methylglyoxal levels in a pathway dependent on oxidative stress."

Specifically, 27% to 61% of the seven samples of A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum showed anti-nociceptive effect and while 34% to 48% of A. sieboldi showed anti-nociceptive effect. The inflammatory inhibition rate of A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum produced in six producing areas (38%-57%) is higher than that of A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum produced in five producing areas (34%-48%). The same kind of Asarum produced in different areas showed significant differences. A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum produced in Jilin province (38%-57%) showed better anti-nociceptive effect than sample produced in Heilongjiang province (34%) in writhing test. A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum produced in Heilongjiang (43%) province showed a better anti-nociceptive effect than samples produced in Liaoning province (29%-36%) in hot plate test. A. sieboldii produced in Shaanxi province (47%-49%) showed a better anti-nociceptive effect than samples produced in Hubei province (40%) in writhing test.

A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum produced in Jilin province (51%-63%) showed better anti-inflammatory effect than samples produced in Heilongjiang province (50%). In totality, the results from analysis of geoherbalism showed that famous-region A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum and A. sieboldii had a better anti-nociception effect than Asarum produced in other producing areas, famous-region A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum had a better effect than those produced in other producing areas in anti-inflammation. But famous-region A. sieboldii showed no obvious difference from those produced in other producing areas in anti-inflammation.All samples of Asarum showed anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects, but with significant differences among Asarum produced in different areas, indicating the eoherbalism to some extent."

Using an artificial grammar task, we compared learning performance in two stimulus\n domains in which respondents have differing tacit prior knowledge. We found that despite grammatically identical sequence\n structures, learning was better for harmonically related chord sequences than for letter name sequences or harmonically unrelated\n chord sequences. We also found transfer effects within the musical and letter name tasks, but not across the domains. We conclude\n that knowledge acquired in implicit learning depends not only on abstract features of structured stimuli, but that the learning\n of regularities is in some respects domain-specific and strongly linked to particular features of the stimulus domain."

  "abstract": "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-way crossover trial was designed to compare the efficacy of famotidine and placebo in preventing meal-provoked upper gastrointestinal symptoms. One hundred twenty-one subjects (58 men and 63 women), aged 20--61 years, were randomly assigned to one of four treatment sequences which included single oral doses of placebo, famotidine 5 mg, famotidine 10 mg, and famotidine 20 mg, spaced approximately 7 days apart. To be eligible for randomization, subjects had to have at least a 2-month history of heartburn and acid/sour stomach occurring at least three times per week. Treatment was administered 1 h prior to ingestion of test meals (chili and wine). Rescue antacid medication (Maalox((R))) was available for subjects who required additional relief. Heartburn severity. acid/sour stomach, and overall discomfort were evaluated on a six-point scale immediately prior to each test meal and every 15 min thereafter for 5 h. A global evaluation of the test medication, using a five-point scale, was performed prior to rescue medication use or at the end of each treatment session. Heartburn and peak acid/sour stomach were rated as significantly milder following prophylactic treatment with famotidine 5, 10, and 20 mg compared to placebo. Treatment with all three doses of famotidine was rated as \"good\" or \"excellent\" by significantly more subjects (58--63%) than following treatment with placebo (38%). In addition, rescue medication was used by significantly fewer subjects following famotidine (17--18%) compared to placebo (37%). Famotidine was generally well tolerated in this trial, with type and frequency of reported adverse experiences similar to that observed following placebo. These results indicated that famotidine doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg were significantly more effective than placebo in preventing symptoms of upper gastrointestinal distress when administered 1 h in advance of meal provocation."

Eleven microwave transitions were newly observed by using a Zeeman-tuned 3.51 μm HeXe laser as the infrared radiation source. The spectrum was analyzed including the 11 transitions previously observed by double resonance. A least-squares fit of the 13 low- J transitions revealed that the rotational constants in the K −1 = 1 states were slightly different from those of the K −1 = 0 states. A higher-order rotational resonance was proposed for explanation of the effect."

  "abstract": "The ultrasonically activated scalpel, a new tool for cutting and coagulating tissue, uses high-frequency ultrasonic vibrations, and has been widely employed in the field of laparoscopic surgery. We evaluated its usefulness for cutting the pancreas in biliary-pancreatic surgery. We planned experimental and clinical studies using an ultrasonically activated scalpel (harmonic scalpel) for cutting the pancreas. The harmonic scalpel was set up at a power level of 3 (75% of full power) in the knife mode. In the experimental study, using dogs, cutting of the pancreas with the harmonic scalpel resulted in significantly less bleeding and significantly less histological tissue damage to the cut stumps than cutting of the pancreas with an electric or a regular scalpel. In the clinical study: (1) the hemostatic effect of the harmonic scalpel was excellent or good in any condition of the pancreas; (2) of 50 stumps of the main pancreatic duct cut with the harmonic scalpel, the stump was easily found in 48 (96%), while ultrasonography was necessary to find the remaining 2 stumps in soft pancreas; (3) in 41 anastomoses (29 soft and 12 hard pancreas) there were no postoperative pancreatic fistulae. These results indicate that the ultrasonically activated scalpel is an effective tool for cutting the pancreas in biliary-pancreatic surgery."

  "abstract": "Louis-Bar (L-B) syndrome, also called ataxia-telangiectasia, is cytogenetically characterized by an increased frequency of spontaneous and induced chromosomal aberrations (CA) in cultured lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts. However, it is not yet clear whether the chromosomal instability is also present in uncultured cells. The spontaneous and bleomycin-induced CA in peripheral lymphocytes of 8 L-B patients were evaluated. The micronucleus test was also performed, for the first time in lymphocytes by the cytokinesis-block method, and in uncultured cells of the oral cavity and hair root. The spontaneous frequency of CA and micronuclei in lymphocytes was about 3 times higher in L-B patients than in controls, these two cytogenetic parameters being highly correlated. Moreover, the induction by bleomycin of CA was higher in patients than in controls. The micronuclei in buccal and hair root cells of patients were normal. It remains to be determined whether the different responses obtained with cultured and uncultured cells are the result of the different L-B gene expression of chromosomal instability or whether they arise because of a particular cell sensitivity to culture conditions. The spontaneous and induced CA in lymphocytes of heterozygotes cultured in the presence of L-B serum were studied to evaluate a possible increased sensitivity of heterozygotes to a possible diffusible clastogenic factor present in the plasma of L-B patients. We could not demonstrate the presence of any factor that enhances CA in normal subjects or in heterozygote carriers."

The internal amplification control was developed by cloning a fragment of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA flanked by sequences specific for T. gondii 529 bp element. A Taqman probe specific for the competitive internal control was designed and tested (YY-BHQ1). We determined the repeatability and reproducibility of the method. A prospective study was performed on adults who received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. After transplantation, patients were monitored once per week during the first 100 days; they were then monitored once every 2 weeks until day 180 after transplantation (i.e., day +180). Results A total of 451 samples from 40 patients were tested. Twenty-five patients had both positive toxoplasmosis serology and an adequate chemoprophylaxis. One sample from one patient was found positive. The rate of reactivation in the population of this study is 4%. Conclusion A monitoring by T. gondii PCR should be realized weekly for patients receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, without an adequate chemoprophylaxis.

  "abstract": "Lung cancer is one of the most difficult challenges for radiotherapy. Problems include ballistic targeting compromised by respiratory movements, poor tolerance of neighboring healthy tissues and difficult dosimetry due to the heterogeneous nature of the thoracic tissues. New perspectives are offered by recent developments allowing a more comprehensive approach to thoracic radiotherapy integrating new advances in imaging techniques, contention, dosimetry, and treatment devices. Two techniques are particularly promising: conformal radiotherapy and respiration-gated radiotherapy. Conformal radiotherapy, a three-dimensional conformal mode of irradiation with or without intensity modulation, is designed to achieve high-precision dose delivery by integrating advanced imaging techniques into the irradiation protocol. These tools are used to optimize irradiation of target volumes and avoid recurrence while sparing as much as possible healthy tissues. If healthy tissue can be correctly protected, increased doses can be delivered to the target tumor. Respiration-gated techniques offer promising prospects for the treatment of tumors which are displaced by respiratory movements. These techniques allow better adaptation of the irradiation fields to the target tumor and better protection of healthy tissues (lung, heart…). These new approaches are now routine practices in many centers. Early results have been very promising. We describe here the currently available techniques for thoracic radiotherapy."

  "abstract": "The BTA TRAK and BTA stat tests for bladder cancer use monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) X13.2 and X52.1 to detect factor H (FH)-related material in urine. The exact ligands remain unknown.Western blot analyses of purified FH, recombinant factor H-related protein 1 (FHR-1), and serum and urine samples were used to identify the ligands of X13.2 and X52.1. Recombinant FH constructs were used to identify the target sites of X13.2 and X52.1. To analyze whether natural ligands of FH could compete with its recognition by the capture mAb X52.1, we used surface plasmon resonance analysis. The role of the ligands of X52.1 in the BTA TRAK assay was tested with use of purified proteins and FH-depleted samples.X13.2 bound to domain 3 of FH and FH-like protein 1, whereas X52.1 bound to domain 18 of FH and to FHR-1. Using specific FH depletion from a bladder cancer patient's urine and purified FH, we demonstrated that FH is the ligand recognized by the BTA TRAK test. By contrast, FHR-1 in urine reduced the FH-dependent test signal.FH is a tumor marker for bladder cancer. To reveal the presence of bladder cancer, the BTA TRAK assay detects FH, whereas FHR-1 is able to partly inhibit this detection. This indicates a special mechanism for a diagnostic immunoassay based on the combined effect of simultaneous positive and negative signals in a single sample."

  "abstract": "Background: Delusions and/or hallucinations are not an uncommon feature in severe major depressive episodes. Functional imaging studies of depression have been widely reported in the literature, but few of these have attempted to investigate the neurophysiological correlates of psychotic symptoms. Methods: We measured resting regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with the 99m Tc-ECD SPECT technique in patients with major depressive disorder with ( n =9) and without ( n =12) psychotic features, as well as in a group of healthy volunteers ( n =12). Between-group rCBF comparisons were performed using the voxel-based statistical parametric mapping method. Results : Major depressed patients with psychotic features showed decreased rCBF in the left subgenual anterior cingulate cortex relative to both non-psychotic patients and healthy controls ( P <0.001 one-tailed, uncorrected for multiple comparisons). Relative to the non-psychotic group, depressed patients with psychotic symptoms also had a focus of decreased rCBF in the right inferior frontal cortex, with the voxel of maximal significance in the insula ( P <0.031, corrected for multiple comparisons). A similar pattern of significant between-group rCBF differences between psychotic and non-psychotic patients emerged after covarying the analysis for the confounding influence of overall illness severity. Conclusions : These results provide preliminary evidence that psychotic symptoms in major depression may be associated with abnormalities in ventral paralimbic regions previously implicated in mood regulation and depression."

  "abstract": "Potassium depletion frequently occurs in primary aldosteronism and has been implicated as the cause of the impaired carbohydrate tolerance frequently associated with this syndrome. Glucose, insulin, and growth hormone regulation were studied in a 42-yr-old, male patient with an aldosterone-secreting adenoma when the patient was potassium-depleted and again after potassium repletion. Potassium repletion was documented by serial body potassium measurements, with an increase in body potassium from 2400 mEq to 2850 mEq after 400 mg spironolactone and 80 mEq supplemental potassium chloride were administered daily for 7 days. Potassium repletion resulted in improvement of the patient's glucose tolerance test, with a decrease in the peak glucose level from 184 mg/100ml to 130 mg/100ml and an increase in the peak insulin level from 46 muU/ml to 85 muU/ml. Intravenous administration of arginine resulted in a subnormal insulin response of 28 muU/ml in the base-line test and an increase to 59 muU/ml after potassium stores were repleted. Growth hormone response to arginine infusion was also initially minimal at 12.5 ng/ml, increasing markedly to 26 ng/ml after potassium replenishment. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia resulted in a depressed growth hormone response of 8 ng/ml when the patient was potassium-deficient, but a normal response of 30 ng/ml after potassium repletion. These observations demonstrate that impairment of both insulin and growth hormone responses to stimulation occur in primary aldosteronism with potassium depletion. These abnormalities may be reversed by potassium repletion."

  "abstract": "Osteopontin (OPN) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that has been recognized as a potential inflammatory cytokine. The function of OPN is modulated by protease digestion, and a thrombin-cleaved form of OPN is involved in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory disorders. We examined thrombin-cleaved OPN products in synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA).Synovial fluid samples were obtained from knees of 20 patients with RA and 111 patients with OA. Thrombin-cleaved OPN product was determined using Western blotting. Levels of thrombin- cleaved and full-length OPN in synovial fluid were determined by ELISA. Synovia were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using an antibody specific to the thrombin-cleaved form.Immunoblotting showed the presence of thrombin-cleaved OPN in synovial fluid from patients with RA and OA. ELISA results showed no difference between concentrations of full-length OPN in the synovial fluid of RA and OA patients; however, thrombin-cleaved OPN concentrations in RA synovial fluid samples were roughly 30-fold higher compared with OA samples (p < 0.001). Synovial fluid concentrations of thrombin-cleaved OPN in RA did not correlate with C-reactive protein levels. Immunohistochemistry of the synovium showed stronger reactivity in RA than in OA samples.Local generation of thrombin-cleaved OPN was increased in RA joints. Thrombin-cleaved OPN may be a useful biochemical marker of RA."

All three alloying elements displace the TTT\n curve for the initiation of transformation to shorter times at the higher reaction temperatures. Both aluminum and silicon\n increase the parabolic rate constant for allotriomorph thickening,α, relative to that in their counterpart Fe-C alloys; the influence of cobalt uponα, if any, is appreciably less. In the Fe-C-Al and Fe-C-Si alloys, thickening proceeds noticeably less rapidly than volume\n diffusion control (as assessed by Atkinson’s analysis of the growth of an oblate ellipsoid) allows. In the Fe-C-Co and Fe-C\n alloys, the average calculated and experimental α’s are in better agreement but, evidently as a result of the presence of\n dislocation facets at a broad face of allotriomorphs, some allotriomorphs actually thickened more rapidly than calculated.\n The substantial scatter inα in all alloys was also attributed to these facets. Indirect determinations indicated that all three elements increased the\n rate of nucleation of ferrite allotriomorphs."

  "abstract": "Using isoelectric focusing (IEF) a number of carboxylic esterase isoenzymes (EC 3.1.1.1) with isoelectric points between pH 4.5-8.0 can be separated. One particular isoenzyme with an isoelectric point at about pH 6.0, the Mono-band, can be selectively and completely inhibited by sodium fluoride; this isoenzyme comprises a number of closely related subcomponents and may appear in more than one band on the gel. We analyzed the expression of typical esterase isoenzyme patterns in cells from a large panel of leukemias which were tested under identical conditions by IEF on horizontal thin-layer polyacrylamide gels with an ampholyte of pH 2-11. The 442 cases of acute and chronic myeloid and lymphoid leukemia (AML/AMMoL, CML/CMML, ALL, CLL) were classified according to clinical, morpho-cytochemical and immunophenotyping criteria. While bands between pH 4.5-5.5 appeared not to be specific for lineage or stage of differentiation, isoenzymes between pH 6.6-7.7 provided information on the type of leukemia involved. Seven typical isoenzyme patterns termed Mono1/Mono2 (fo monocyte-associated), My1/My2 (myeloid), Lym1/Lym2 (lymphoid) and Und (undifferentiated) could be discerned. Lym and Und patterns are characterized by fewer bands with a weaker staining intensity than Mono and My patterns. Nearly all cases of lymphoid leukemias (acute and chronic) expressed only Lym or Und esterase isoenzyme patterns, but no Mono or My patterns. Cases of acute or chronic myeloid and (myelo)monocytic leukemia showed strong isoenzyme staining displaying predominantly Mono or My isoenzyme patterns. The isoenzyme patterns found in CML in lymphoid or myeloid blast crisis corresponded to those seen in the respective acute leukemias, ALL or AML. The Mono-band was found in most cases of leukemias with monocytic elements (AMMoL 80%, CML 44%, CMML 100%), in the occasional case of CML-myeloid blast crisis or AML, but in none of the cases of ALL or CLL. This isoenzyme is a distinctive, specific marker for leukemias of monocytic origin and is of discriminatory value for the differentiation of monocytic from non-monocytic leukemia variants. Esterase isoenzyme profiles can give additional evidence on the origin and stage of differentiation of leukemic cells. "

  "abstract": "While theorists differ sharply on the expected economic impact of stock options, typically empirical work has found a positive association between option schemes and firm productivity. However, existing data are limited and may not enable reliable investigation of the productivity effects. New panel data for all Finnish publicly listed firms during 1992-2002 enable us to distinguish plans that are broad based and others limited to particular employees and address issues of endogeneity concerning inputs and options. Diverse specifications are estimated including dynamic panel data models with a GMM estimator. For broad-based option scheme indicators the key result is that different estimators consistently find statistically insignificant associations with firm productivity. For selective option schemes, the baseline fixed effects estimator suggests a 2.1-2.4% positive and statistically significant effect on firm productivity. However, in empirical models in which endogeneity and dynamics are taken into account, no evidence is found of a link with firm productivity. Thus our findings are consistent with hypotheses that predict negligible effects of option plans for enterprise performance, such as those based on free riding, or psychological expectancy theory or accounting myopia. However, by finding weak evidence for productivity effects of targeted schemes (and none for broad-based plans) our findings tend not to support hypotheses based on managerial rent seeking."

  "abstract": "The study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and its risk factors among the attendees of primary health care centers in a Saudi sub-urban community. A cross- sectional survey was conducted during March and April 2002. Out of eight satellite clinics, four clinics were selected by using systematic random sampling. All 451 attendees older than 18 years were included in the study sample, but 71 of them refused to undergo the blood investigations. Thus, three hundred eighty (380) subjects were screened for diabetes mellitus and associated car- diovascular risk factors including the assessment of lifestyle, obesity, hypertension, smoking and hyperlipidemia. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus was found to be 15.8% (24.2% in males and 11.3% in females) only 23.3% of them were well controlled. Fifteen percent (15%) of the diabetics were undiag- nosed. The mean fasting plasma glucose increased significantly with increase in age (p= 0.04), BMI (p= 0.01), blood pressure (p= 0.03), cholesterol level (p= 0.01) and triglycerides level (p= 0.02). No statistical significant association with frequency of exercise (p=0.50) was observed. Dia- betes mellitus and associated cardiovascular risk factors are prevalent in the study population, which are more among males as compared to females. An early detection program for diabetes mellitus and associated cardiovascular risk factors is needed. Such a program will contribute to the improvement of quality of life of the population."

  "abstract": "Abstract—Tropical  Pacific  insular  streams  are  relatively  unexplored compared to  streams  in  temperate  or  other  tropical  regions,  and  more stream studies are necessary because human,population growth threatens these unique  island  ecosystems.  The  population  of  Tutuila,  the  largest island of American Samoa, has grown exponentially in recent years. This report presents historical water quality data [total nitrogen (TN), nitrate (NO3‐+NO2‐),  total  phosphorus  (TP)]  for  eleven  perennial  streams  on Tutuila  sampled ,between ,1979  and  1996.  Data  from  1979  show ,that streams impacted ,by  human ,activities  exhibited  a  higher ,median ,TN concentration (520 μg/L) than reference streams (329 μg/L). A similar difference was observed for NO3‐+NO2‐. There was no significant differ- ence between  impacted  and  reference  stream  TP (129  vs.  102  μg/L, respectively). Data  from ,the  entire  period ,indicate  that  TN  and NO3‐+NO2‐ demonstrated,more between year variability (CV=60.2% and 26.5%, respectively)  than  did  TP (CV=19.9%).  Overall,  though,  these data do not demonstrate any obvious trends towards increasing nutrients in these island streams. Data suggest that the baseline nutrient levels are ca. 200‐300 μg TN/L and 50‐100 μg TP/L for reference streams on this island. These  numbers ,are  supported  by  data ,collected  in  1997  from Laufuti Stream,  a  stream  located  in  an  uninhabited  watershed  on  the nearby island of Ta’u, American Samoa. Future monitoring must exam- ine the  full  range  of  stream ,types  to  accurately ,assess  these  insular stream ecosystems."

  "abstract": "Consumers are more and more aware of ecological and economical products than ever before. This concern for the environment can be found in all types of consumer products. In this study, we are interested in the colors of paper given that paper manufacturing processes thus far have focused on the whiteness of the paper, the creation of which is closely related to environmental damage. The creation process includes bleaching or fluorescence agents and the use of extra energy accordingly. Therefore, questions arise as to whether this process in essential to make paper and to what extent we can reduce the use of agents in order to reduce environmental damage and lower the costs of manufacturing(1). In order to answer these questions, this study attempts to determine which level of white or colored paper is acceptable to consumers. In the first part of the study, consumer tolerance levels of the acceptance of colored paper were investigated to discover the influence of environmental attitudes on color tolerance. Surveys were conducted that asked about the border colors the participants would tolerate as colors of appropriateness for paper color in eight conditions that were dichotomously varied in terms of the three contextual variables of intention (use versus buy), usage (office paper versus workbook paper), and recycled status (not necessarily recycled or recycled). For color stimuli, 266 samples were collected and then displayed in 19 columns by 14 rows on DIN A2 size paper. For the second part of the study, the participants' environmental attitudes were assessed via Milfont and Duckitt's EAI-24(2). Individual attitudes toward the environment were quantitatively analyzed and obtained evidence to test the hypothesis that attitudes toward the environment affect consumer tolerance of paper colors. tolerance should also be positively correlated with the seriousness of one's attitude towards the environment. Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether this effect exists and if so, how one could characterize that effect. By understanding that consumers' \"green attitude\" affects their acceptance of recycled material, the study particularly focuses on consumers' readiness to accept colored recycled paper. Additionally, the study attempts to demonstrate that an individual's involvement in environmental issues could also be an influential factor. Japanese and Korean participants participated in this study, since Korea and Japan are among the leading countries regarding paper recovery by means of the systematic separation of garbage before its collection in both countries. Thus, the effect of cultural and environmental/geographical surroundings on consumer awareness of ecological products was also investigated. 2 Goal"

  "abstract": "GGobi is a direct descendent of a data visualization system called XGobi that has been around since the early 1990s. GGobi's new features include multiple plotting windows, a color lookup table manager, and an Extensible Markup Language file format for data. Perhaps the biggest advance is that GGobi can be easily extended, either by being embedded in other software or by the addition of plugins; either way, it can be controlled using an Application Programming Interface. An illustration of its extensibility is that it can be embedded in R. The result is a full marriage between GGobi's direct manipulation graphical environment and R's familiar extensible environment for statistical data analysis."

Staging according to the definitive histological findings was as follows: pT0 in 24 patients (17.8%), pT1 in 66 patients (48.8%) and pT2 in 45 patients (33.4%).Minor complications were observed in 12 patients (8.8%) whereas major complications were seen only in 2 patients (1.5%). At a median follow-up of 78 (36-125) months, local recurrences occurred in 4 patients and distal metastasis in 2 patients (all patients were staged preoperatively T2). Disease-free survival rates in T1 and T2 patients were 100 and 93% respectively at the end of follow-up.With respect to local recurrence and survival rate, the long-term results of early stage rectal cancer in patients treated with transanal endoscopic microsurgery were similar to those reported in the literature after conventional surgery (total mesorectal excision)."

  "abstract": "Previous work on the whole neurohypophysis has shown that hypotonic conditions increase release of taurine from neurohypophysial astrocytes (pituicytes). The present work confirms that taurine is present in cultured pituicytes, and that its specific release increases in response to a hypotonic shock. We next show that vasopressin (VP) and oxytocin (OT) also specifically release taurine from pituicytes. With an EC(50) of approximately 2 nm, VP is much more potent than OT, and the effects of both hormones are blocked by SR 49059, a V(1a) receptor antagonist. This pharmacological profile matches the one for VP- and OT-evoked calcium signals in pituicytes, consistent with the fact that VP-induced taurine efflux is blocked by BAPTA-AM. However, BAPTA-AM also blocks the taurine efflux induced by a 270 mosmol l(-1) challenge, which per se does not evoke any calcium signal, suggesting a permissive role for calcium in this case. Nevertheless, the fact that structurally unrelated calcium-mobilizing agents and ionomycin are able to induce taurine efflux suggests that calcium may also play a signalling role in this event. It is widely accepted that in hypotonic conditions taurine exits cells through anionic channels. Antagonism by the chloride channel inhibitors 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid (DIDS) and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoic acid (NPPB) suggests the same pathway for VP-induced taurine efflux, which is also blocked in hypertonic conditions (330 mosmol l(-1)). Moreover, it is likely that the osmosensitivity of the taurine channel is up-regulated by calcium. These results, together with our in situ experiments showing stimulation of taurine release by endogenous VP, strengthen the concept of a glial control of neurohormone output."

  "abstract": "Cache Miss Equations (CME) (S. Ghosh et al., 1997) is a method that accurately describes the cache behavior by means of polyhedra. Even though the computation cost of generating CME is a linear function of the number of references, solving them is a very time consuming task and thus trying to study a whole program may be infeasible. The paper presents effective techniques that exploit some properties of the particular polyhedra generated by CME. Such techniques reduce the complexity of the algorithm to solve CME, which results in a significant speedup when compared with traditional methods. In particular, the proposed approach does not require the computation of the vertices of each polyhedron, which has an exponential complexity."

Photonic core shell materials having\n a core and shell domains composed by a variety of compounds have been synthesized by different methods. In this work we used\n silica-germania soot prepared by vapor-phase axial deposition as a core where a nanoshell of Eu2O3 was deposited. A new sol-gel like method was used to obtain the Eu2O3 nanoshell coating the SiO2–GeO2 particles, which was prepared by the polymeric precursor method. The photophysical properties of Eu3+ were used to obtain information about the rare earth surrounding in the SiO2–GeO2@Eu2O3 material during the sintering process. The sintering process was followed by the luminescence spectra of Eu3+ and all the samples present the characteristic emission related to the 5D0→7F\n J\n  (J = 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4). The ratios of the 5D0→7F2/5D0→7F1 emission intensity for the SiO2–GeO2@Eu2O3 systems were calculated and it was observed an increase in its values, indicating a low symmetry around the Eu3+ as the temperature increases."

  "abstract": "Modern location-aware services and applications use context and prediction methods to adapt to the needs of users and changes in the environment. The growing availability of WLAN and mobile devices offers significant opportunities for location-aware services. But the use of WLAN or RFID technologies alone provides a less accurate estimation of a user's current location. In this paper, we introduce an ontology-based location tracking system. It makes use of both WLAN and RFID technologies, and includes a prediction method for identifying a user's current location and predicted future location. Our system architecture better serves the client by using location and context information."

  "abstract": "We present results using a coupled chemistry/climate model to study changes in tropospheric ozone between 2000 and 2100. We assess changes first due to the increased emissions of NOx and VOCs (using the IPCC SRES scenario A2) and then due to both emission changes and the anticipated climate change with doubled CO2. In 2100, with the scenarios used, there is a substantial calculated increase in tropospheric O3, but in contrast to earlier studies, the increase is larger for doubled CO2. The increases are most pronounced in the extratropical middle and upper troposphere; changes in circulation and a chemically induced increase in lower stratospheric O3, mainly due to reduced temperatures there, both enhance stratosphere/troposphere exchange. These changes in the lower stratosphere are crucial to our results."

  "abstract": "Recent studies have shown independently that presenilin-1 (PS1) null mutants and familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD)-linked mutants should both down-regulate signaling of the unfolded protein response (UPR). However, it is difficult to accept that both mutants possess the same effects on the UPR. Furthermore, contrary to these observations, neither loss of PS1 and PS2 function nor expression of FAD-linked PS1 mutants were reported to have a discernable impact on the UPR. Therefore, re-examination and detailed analyses are needed to clarify the relationship between PS1 function and UPR signaling. Here, we report that PS1/PS2 null and dominant negative PS1 mutants, which are mutated at aspartate residue 257 or 385, did not affect signaling of the UPR. In contrast, FAD-linked PS1 mutants were confirmed to disturb UPR signaling by inhibiting activation of both Ire1alpha and ATF6, both of which are endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress transducers in the UPR. Furthermore, PS1 mutants also disturbed activation of PERK (PKR-like ER kinase), which plays a crucial role in inhibiting translation during ER stress. Taken together, these observations suggested that PS1 mutations could affect signaling pathways controlled by each of the respective ER-stress transducers, possibly through a gain-of-function."

  "abstract": "Summary Two experiments were established to determine the early nutrient requirements for plantations of Eucalyptus globulus (Nabowla site) and E. nitens (Westfield site) in Tasmania, Australia. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were broadcast together, 2 and 26 months after planting, at cumulative rates of up to 1200 kg N ha-1 and 600 kg P ha-1. Soil chemistry was characterised at each site in three profiles, and in all plots at the Westfield site. Nabowla has a relatively infertile, poorly structured soil, low in N and P, and receives about 800 mm of rainfall per annum. Growth was very poor without fertiliser, but trees responded rapidly and strongly to added NP. Stem volume increased directly with the rate of applied fertiliser, with no evidence that the response had peaked at the highest rate. Even at the highest rate of NP fertiliser, however, productivity was relatively low (mean annual increment about 15 m3 ha-1 y-1). Establishment of plantations on such sites is unlikely to be economically viable, with or without fertiliser, but fertile ex-pasture sites that are otherwise similar should be considered. Westfield has a relatively fertile, well-structured soil, and receives 1400-1500 mm of rainfall per annum. Response to NP fertiliser was delayed at this site, with first responses measured 33 months after planting. The response in stem volume was sigmoidal in relation to fertiliser rate, with a plateau at an application rate of 400 kg N ha-1 and 200 kg P ha-1. This rate of fertiliser is expected to increase mean annual increment from 20 (without fertiliser) to 25 m3 ha-1 y-1. Splitting applications of fertiliser at the highest rate did not alter the growth response. Although high rates of N and P fertiliser may be required to maximise growth of eucalypt plantations in Tasmania on ex-forest sites, rates required during the first few years might be lower than those reported here if the timing and placement of fertiliser is optimised. Soil chemical analyses were indicative of N and P requirements, and about a third of the variation in growth across the Westfield site was accounted for by natural variability in initial concentrations of total P and exchangeable K in surface soil."

It maintains that the author(s) should take the learner's needs as the departure point to write a textbook and only those idioms that are most frequently used in modern Chinese can be chosen as the content of such a textbook.It emphasizes that the structure and function of an idiom should be analyzed and the idiom be explained in such a way that the environment of usage is embodied not only in definition,but also in examples.To sum it up,a textbook of Chinese idioms should serve as a tool to remove the obstacles that hinder foreigners to learn Chinese idioms and to usher them to the world of Chinese conveniently."

  "abstract": "This paper examines the status of Corporate Ethical Policies (CEP) in large companies in Argentina, Brazil and Spain, with a special emphasis on Corporate Ethics Statements (CES), documents that define the firms’ philosophy, values and norms of conduct. It is based on a survey of the 500 largest companies in these nations. The findings reveal many similarities between these countries. Among other things, it emerges that most companies give consideration to ethics in business and have adopted some kind of formal or informal ethical policies. Regardless of whether or not they have a CES, companies agree that ethical conduct must be taken into account when selecting, appraising and promoting personnel as an important ethical policy. There is a growing tendency to draw up formal corporate ethics documents. These documents are perceived, first and foremost, as supporting the development of corporate culture. Most respondents believe that primary responsibility for ethical issues in the company rests with the CEO. Finally, the findings indicate that most companies that devote more resources to communicating and implementing CESs have two or more formal ethics documents. The main differences between the countries included in the study concern the emphasis given to specific aspects, such as avoiding misconduct or taking ethical criteria into account when selecting personnel. The emphasis is greatest in countries where corruption seems most prevalent."

  "abstract": "This essay revisits the decades-long debate about racial representation in Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Fi nn and suggests, looking beyond the rigid binary of either demanding a ban on the novel or belittling its racially offensive aspects, that in racial terms Twain's creation of the Huck-Jim relationship reflects what was in the author's own life and worldview a muddled terrain of good intentions, confusion, wavering, and inconsistency. While Twain may not have inscribed his incomplete struggle with the 'race question' in the novel deliberately, such an imprint was a de facto outcome of his writing process. A cusp text, Huckleberry Finn is, on the one hand, shackled and diminished by its view of African Americans as Others; on the other hand, the novel does contain an effort, albeit a flawed and unfinished one, to transcend the limitations of post-Reconstruction racism and racialism. This article examines these tension-ridden dynamics of racial representation in Huckleberry Finn by focusing on Twain's portrayal of Jim as a father figure for Huck (a relationship that temporarily transgresses the depicted era's prevalent racial hierarchies) and on the novel's noteworthy, though lamentably incomplete, deconstruction of meanings conventionally attached to whiteness and blackness in nineteenth-century America. This essay argues that Huckleberry Finn—a complex text of whose different layers and threads Twain was not necessarily in full control—both illustrates and mimics historical processes whereby shackles of racialized perception are at first partly opened and then, disappointingly, partly closed again."

  "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel interpolation algorithm based on the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model, which uses fuzzy direction-oriented interpolation (FDOI). The proposed algorithm can choose the most suitable deinterlacing methods for interpolation of a missing pixel by using an area classifier that classifies the content of a frame into three different categories. The proposed FDOI utilizes fuzzy theory to find the most accurate edge direction in which to interpolate missing pixels. The shape of the membership functions used in fuzzy logic are designed adaptively according to the parameters. Detection and interpolation results are presented. The results of computer simulations show that the proposed method outperforms a number of methods in the literature"

  "abstract": "Biochemical roles of the representative enzymes involved in carbon metabolism of glucose were investigated in relation to\n the fruit-body formation of the basidiomycete Flammulina velutipes. Changes in specific activities of the enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glyoxylate (GLOX) and gluconeogenesis\n pathways were measured at different stages of development of the fungus. The enzyme activities of malate synthase (MS) and\n fructose bisphosphatase (FBP) as the key enzymes for the GLOX-gluconeogenesis pathways increased in mycelia during the fruit-body\n formation. The activities of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) for the TCA cycle and NADP-linked glutamate dehydrogenase (GLTDH\n (NADP)) for glutamate synthesis increased more markedly. Moreover, the mycelial mat of the cultures producing fruit bodies\n yielded greater enzyme activities of isocitrate lyase (ICL), MS, FBP, and IDH than that of the cultures that did not produce\n fruit bodies. These results suggest that the GLOX-gluconeogenesis pathways as well as the glutamate synthesis have a strong\n correlation with the fruit-body formation of F. velutipes."

PrP(C) is highly conserved in mammals, moreover, genes of PrP-related proteins have been recently identified in fish. While there is only little sequence homology to mammalian PrP, PrP-related fish proteins were predicted to be modified with N-linked glycans and a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. We biochemically characterized two PrP-related proteins from zebrafish in cultured cells and show that both zePrP1 and zeSho2 are imported into the endoplasmic reticulum and are post-translationally modified with complex glycans and a C-terminal GPI anchor."

  "abstract": "Peritumoral edema, one of the major causes for neurological disorders in brain tumor patients, is mainly treated with steroids, which unfortunately have significant side effects and interfere with the efficacy of chemotherapy. Boswellic acids, the main active ingredients of Boswellia serrata, are antiinflammatory agents, inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase, the key enzyme of leukotriene biosynthesis and one of the pathophysiological mechanisms of peritumoral edema. Based on positive results in clinical trials and animal studies, B. serrata resin dry extract was designated an orphan drug by the European Commission for the treatment of peritumoral edema resulting from brain tumors. Thus boswellic acids may be alternative drugs to corticosteroids. However, the question of the availability of boswellic acids in brain has not been addressed until now. Accordingly, a highly sensitive LC/MS method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of KBA and AKBA, the most potent boswellic acids, in plasma and brain. This method involves matrix-assisted liquid-liquid extraction on Extrelut NT followed by separation on reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry detection using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization. Excellent linearity was obtained for the entire calibration range from 5 to 1500 ng/mL KBA and AKBA in plasma and 5 to 1000 ng/mL KBA and AKBA in brain. Validation assays of the lower limit of quantification as well as for the intra- and interday precision and accuracy met the international acceptance criteria for bioanalytical method validation. Moreover, the interchangeability of calibration curves generated in pork and rat brain homogenates could be demonstrated. Using the developed analytical method, KBA and AKBA could be detected for the first time in brain up to a concentration of 99 and 95 ng/g of brain, respectively, 3 h after the single oral administration of 240 mg/kg of dry B. serrata resin extract to Wistar rats. The developed method represents an appropriate tool to further study the time-dependent distribution of KBA and AKBA in plasma and brain as well as the absolute brain concentration after multiple doses and contributes thus to the optimization of the dosage regimen and to a better understanding of the therapeutic effects of B. serrata."

  "abstract": "J. Inst. Brew. 114(4), 357-364, 2008 There is a vast repository of knowledge regarding improving beer taste stability via wort boiling. However, as far as we are aware, there are few reports dealing with taste stability improve- ment in terms of quality characteristics by boiling, under proper conditions, the first wort and second worts separately. In this study, more than 50 brews in a pilot scale brewing facility were conducted to investigate suitable boiling conditions for first and second worts. When the second wort (i.e., the last 10% of the total filtered wort) was kept under a low heat load atmosphere (78°C), casted to the boiling first wort, and then re-boiled for 10 min, the produced beer exhibited no significant differences com- pared to that of the general beer in terms of taste stability. How- ever, when an adsorbent (bentonite, silica gel, activated carbon or PVPP) was individually added to the second wort and the same boiling procedure was performed, the oxidized flavour of the forced aged beer, treated with activated carbon, significantly decreased, compared to that of the general brew (level of signifi- cance α = 0.01). The data from the chemical analysis and fer- mentation behavior are presented."

  "abstract": "We consider the Eliashberg theory in the coupling region where some\nfundamental qualitative deviations from the conventional BCS-like behaviour\nbegin to appear. These deviations are identified as the onset of a cross-over\nfrom BCS superconductivity to Bose condensation. We point out that the\nbeginning of this cross-over occurs when the gap $\\Delta_g$ becomes comparable\nto the boson energies $\\Omega_{ph}$. This condition is equivalent to the\ncondition of Ref. \\cite{Strinati} $k_F\\xi\\approx 2\\pi$ and traduces the\nphysical constraint that the distance the paired electron covers during the\nabsorbtion of the virtual boson, cannot be larger than the coherence length.\nThe frontier region of couplings is of the order of $\\lambda\\approx 3$, and\nhigh-$T_c$ materials are concerned. A clear qualitative indication of the\noccurence of a cross-over regime should be a dip structure above the gap in the\ndensity of states of excitations. Comparing our results with tunneling and\nphotoemission experiments we conclude that high-$T_c$ materials (cuprates and\nfullerides) are indeed at the beginning of a cross-over from BCS\nsuperconductivity to Bose condensation, even though the fermionic nature still\nprevails. Taking into account the analysis of Ref. \\cite{Strinati}, we predict\na dip structure in heavy fermion and organic superconductors. Non-adiabatic\neffects beyond Migdal's theory are considered and give insight on the\nrobustness of Eliashberg theory in describing qualitatively this cross-over\nregime, although for the quantitative interpretation of the results the\ninclusion of non-adiabatic corrections can be important."

  "abstract": "Pattern-based video coding representing moving regions in macroblock has very good potential for improved coding efficiency over existing standard H.264/AVC in the very low bit-rate range. However, the coding efficiency diminishes compared to H.264 with the bit rates because variable block sizes of H.264 for motion estimation and compensation are successfully selected for any bit rates using weighting between bit rate and image quality. The existing pattern-based video coding scheme could not handle this flexibility with bit rates due to its fixed size and lack of verification with other modes of H.264. In this paper we propose two large and one small pre-defined pattern sets and treat them as extra modes of H.264. We also investigate the weighting factor between bit rate and image quality compared to the existing one. The experimental results confirm the superiority of our approach compared to H.264 and other existing pattern-based video coding for not only the very low bit rate range but also wide range of bit rates."

  "abstract": "The complement system , composed of several plasma and membrane proteins, is an integral part of the innate immune system and plays a role in inflammatory response, destruction of infectious agents, elimination of immune complexes, and control of the specific (adaptive) immune response. Hereditary deficiencies of complement components are relatively rare and associated with susceptibility to a wide variety of clinical diseases. Complement components may be target of antibodies (anti-C1q, factor H, C3 alternative convertase, or C3NeF autoantibodies or anti-C1 inhibitor antibodies) that lead to acquired deficiencies. Testing the complement system is especially necessary in patients with autoimmune diseases, some kidney diseases, recurrent infections (especially meningococcal), and angioedema. Precise clinical descriptions of the phenotypes associated with these deficiencies and their molecular diagnosis are necessary to improve our understanding of the role that the complement system plays in the physiopathological mechanisms of these diseases and to propose the most specific treatment for them."

  "abstract": "The effects of dobutamine infusion on left ventricular (LV) function in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) have not been completely defined. Some studies have suggested that dobutamine infusion can be used to achieve a significant increase in myocardial oxygen demand in the presence of severe stenosis, revealing physiologically significant ischemia. 1–3 This would be particularly desirable as an alternative to exercise stress testing because some patients are unable to achieve target heart rates due to insufficient motivation, poor physical condition or peripheral vascular disease. Studies with contrast ventriculography using postextrasystolic stimulation and epinephrine infusion have suggested that viable, but poorly contracting myocardium, often responds to these stimuli and can thus be differentiated from infarcted, irreversibly injured myocardium. 4,5 The pharmacologic profile of dobutamine as a relatively selective β-1 agonist 6 suggests that dobutamine also may stimulate viable but “hibernating” myocardium. 5 In this report, the effects of dobutamine infusion on global LV ejection fraction and abnormal LV regional wall motion have been assessed in 15 patients with coronary artery disease. The goal of the study was to determine whether dobutamine “stress” would induce a diminished LV ejection fraction and provoke new LV wall motion abnormalities or improve global and/or regional LV dysfunction."

  "abstract": "Although lattice models have been very successful in modelling many aspects of epitaxial growth, the confinement of atoms to sites on a regular lattice is a severe impediment to extending these simulation studies to the heteroepitaxial growth of materials with a lattice mismatch. In principle molecular dynamics overcomes this limitation, but the disparity between simulational and laboratory timescales limits this method to the submonolayer regime of growth. Following the early work of Faux et al. [Phys. Rev. B 42 (1990) 2914], we have developed a Monte Carlo simulation where a continuous range of atomic positions are allowed. By adopting hard sphere interactions and a simple form of site hopping, we have investigated the effects of mismatch on the growth mode and made comparisons with Lennard-Jones molecular dynamics simulations. We will discuss the strengths and limitations of this way of combining the Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics methods for modelling epitaxial growth."

  "abstract": "Chromosome banding analysis of seven diploid parthenogenetic females from Polynesian and Southeast Asian populations of the unisexual-bisexual Lepidodactylus lugubris complex (Reptilia, Gekkonidae) showed that the unisexual karyotype consists of two different haploid sets. Similar analysis of an L. lugubris male from a bisexually reproducing population revealed two identical chromosome complements, the banding pattern generally matching that of the females, although many chromosomes were obviously different. These observations suggest that the gonochoristic males belong to a taxon related to the parthenogenetic female taxon but are not a direct ancestor of the latter. The data also offer strong evidence for a hybrid origin of diploid parthenogenetic females in L. lugubris and suggest that a high degree of chromosomal heterogeneity may be the leading reason for the evolutionary selection of a modified meiotic process in this species, allowing production of unreduced oocytes and, consequently, of a unisexual mode of reproduction."

  "abstract": "The molecular basis of the membranolytic activity of the membrane attack complex (MAC) of complement was investigated. By using density gradient equilibrium ultracentrifugation, the binding of egg yolk lecithin to the isolated MAC and to its intermediate complexes and precursor proteins was measured. No stable phospholipid--protein complexes were formed with the MAC precursor components C5b--6, C7, C8, and C9. Stable complexes of phospholipid and protein were formed by C5b--7, C5b--8, C5b--9, and the MAC (C5b--9 dimer) and they exhibited densities of 1.2164, 1.184, 1.2055, and 1.2275 g/ml, respectively. The molar phospholipid/protein ratios for the four complexes were determined to be: C5b--7, 399:1, C5b--5, 841:1; C5b--9, 918:1; and C5b--9 dimer, 1460:1. Electron microscopy of the isolated phospholipid--protein complexes revealed no lipid bilayer structures. The magnitude of the phospholipid binding capacity of the MAC is consistent with the interpretation that the MAC forms phospholipid--protein mixed in micelles in lipid bilayers and biological membranes and thus causes formation of hydrophilic lipid channels."

  "abstract": "This paper studies debt holders’ belief updating, valuation of corporate debt, and equity owners’ financing decisions during financial distress under asymmetric information. This is done within a continuous-time framework, where the relevant state variable is assumed to follow an Arithmetic Brownian motion (ABM). ABM can take negative values and has very realistic feature compared with Geometric Brownian motion (GBM). Using Chapter 11 of U.S. Bankruptcy Code as a costly screening device, we can characterize which firm will choose private workouts (in the form of strategic debt service) and which will choose to file for the Chapter 11 Bankruptcy procedure (in the form of debt–equity swap) when the firm is in financial distress. Using arguments similar to equilibrium refinements, we give a clear picture of how debt holders’ beliefs about the firm’s types are updated according to the state variable and the firm’s default behavior, and describe optimal strategies of both parties under those beliefs. We also provide an approximate solution to the debt pricing problem under asymmetric information."

We present a comprehensive spectral analysis of the six XMM-Newton\nobservations of the source (for a total of ~200 ks), focusing on the detailed\nand systematic search for absorption features in the high-energy data. We\ndetect several absorption features at rest-frame energies ~8-8.5 keV and ~9.7\nkeV. The lines are consistent with being produced by H-like iron Ka and Kb\nshell absorptions associated with an outflow with mildly relativistic velocity\nof ~0.14-0.2 c. The lines are found to be variable in energy and, marginally in\nintensity, implying that variations in either the column density, geometry\nand/or ionization structure of the outflow are common in this source."

  "abstract": "According to recent in vitro experiments, the peptide transporter PepT2 is stimulated by the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase SGK1. The present study explored the contribution of SGK1 to the regulation of electrogenic intestinal peptide transport. Intestinal PepT1 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and peptide transport was determined by dual electrode voltage clamping. Peptide transport in intestinal segments was determined utilizing Ussing chamber. Cytosolic pH (pH( i )) was determined by BCECF fluorescence and Na(+)/H(+) exchanger activity was estimated from Na(+)-dependent pH recovery (pH ( i )) following an ammonium pulse. In PepT1-expressing Xenopus oocytes, coexpression of SGK1 enhanced electrogenic peptide transport. Intestinal transport and pH( i ) of untreated mice were similar in SGK1 knockout mice (sgk1 ( -/- )) and their wild-type littermates (sgk1 ( +/+ )). Glucocorticoid treatment (4 days 10 microg/g body weight (bw)/day dexamethasone) increased peptide transport in sgk1 ( +/+ ) but not in sgk1 (-/-) mice. Irrespective of dexamethasone treatment, luminal peptide (5 mM glycyl-glycine) led to a similar early decrease of pH( i ) in sgk1 (-/-) and sgk1 (+/+) mice, but to a more profound and sustained decline of pH( i ) in sgk1 (-/-) than in sgk1 ( +/+ ) mice. In the presence and absence of glycyl-glycine, pH ( i ) was significantly enhanced by dexamethasone treatment in sgk1 ( +/+ ) mice, an effect significantly blunted in sgk1 ( -/- ) mice. During sustained exposure to glycyl-glycine, pH ( i ) was significantly larger in sgk1 (+/+) mice than in sgk1 (-/-) mice, irrespective of dexamethasone treatment. In conclusion, basal intestinal peptide transport does not require stimulation by SGK1. Glucocorticoid treatment stimulates both Na(+)/H(+) exchanger activity and peptide transport, effects partially dependent on SGK1. Moreover, chronic exposure to glycyl-glycine stimulates Na(+)/H(+) exchanger activity, an effect again involving SGK1."

  "abstract": "The purpose of this research is to assess the feasibility of applying expert systems techniques for improved error control and productivity of commercial programming. Error control in programming: error detection, error removal and error prevention is a major problem for productivity (Jones,1986). Improved error control appears to offer substantial potential for improving programmer productivity. The purpose of this paper is to analyze and describe the structure of an expert systems model for COBOL debugging. COBOL was selected as part of this research due to its importance in commercial programming. The Data Processing Management Association's Educational Foundation has sponsored the development of a pilot model suitable for testing the feasibility of this research. This is a preliminary paper which is limited to the development of the expert systems model and it's rationale. As this is an early paper, feedback and suggestions are solicited.This paper is organized into two major sections. The first part reports on utilizing previous empirical research on COBOL error frequency to build a knowledge base of errors in programming. The second part of the paper is an analysis of an expert systems model in which the COBOL error frequency and debugging strategies are implemented on an experimental basis."

  "abstract": "Interrupt processing can be a major bottleneck in the end-to-end performance of high-speed networks. The performance of Gigabit network end hosts or servers can be severely degraded due to interrupt overhead caused by heavy incoming traffic. Under heavy network traffic, the system performance will be negatively affected due to interrupt overhead caused by the incoming traffic. In particular, excessive latency and significant degradation in system throughput can be experienced. In this paper, we present a throughput-delay analysis of such behavior. We develop analytical models based on queueing theory and Markov processes. In our analysis, we consider and model three systems: ideal, PIO, and DMA. In ideal system, the interrupt overhead is ignored. In PIO, DMA is disabled and copying of incoming packets is performed by the CPU. In DMA, copying of incoming packet is performed by DMA engines. For high-speed network hosts, both PIO and DMA can be desirable configuration options. The analysis yields insight into understanding and predicting the impact of system and network choices on the performance of interrupt-driven systems when subjected to light and heavy network loads. Simulations and reported experimental results show that our analytical models are valid and give a good approximation."

  "abstract": "Tubulolobular carcinoma (TLC) of the breast is a rare subtype of breast carcinoma categorized by Fisher et al. (Hum Pathol\n 8:679–683, 1977) as a tubular variant of lobular carcinoma. E-cadherin is a transmembrane glycoprotein, and complete loss\n of E-cadherin expression has been observed in invasive lobular carcinoma. Ductal carcinoma retains at least some expression\n of E-cadherin. Moreover, the adhesive function of E-cadherin is dependent on the integrity of the catenin components, which\n link E-cadherin to the actin filaments. In order to achieve improved categorization of TLC, we decided to investigate both\n E-cadherin and the catenins in TLCs and invasive lobular carcinomas. We reviewed all 1,430 cases of primary breast carcinoma\n that were surgically resected at Saitama Medical Center, Saitama Medical School, and at Saitama Red Cross Hospital between\n 1990 and 2005. Among these, 16 cases of TLC were reported retrospectively. The results were compared with those of 20 cases\n of invasive lobular carcinomas that were included as controls. Tumor tissue was immunostained for E-cadherin, α-catenin, and\n β-catenin. The presence of immunoreactivity in the TLC was seen in 12 (75%) cases for E-cadherin, in 8 (50%) cases for α-catenin,\n and in 10 (62.5%) cases for β-catenin. However, plasma-membrane-associated staining for E-cadherin, α-catenin, and β-catenin\n was completely absent in invasive lobular carcinomas. These results suggest the possibility that TLCs are not a variant of\n lobular carcinoma, but rather ductal carcinomas with a lobular growth pattern."

  "abstract": "Axial X-ray diffraction patterns have been studied from relaxed, contracted and rigor vertebrate striated muscles at different sarcomere lengths to determine which features of the patterns depend on the interaction of actin and myosin. The intensity of the myosin layer lines in a live, relaxed muscle is sometimes less in a stretched muscle than in the muscle at rest-length; the intensity depends not only on the sarcomere length but on the time that has elapsed since dissection of the muscle. The movement of cross-bridges giving rise to these intensity changes are not caused solely by the withdrawal of actin from the A-band. When a muscle contracts or passes into rigor many changes occur that are independent of the sarcomere length: the myosin layer lines decrease in intensity to about 30% of their initial value when the muscle contracts, and disappear completely when the muscle passes into rigor. Both in contracting and rigor muscles at all sarcomere lengths the spacings of the meridional reflections at 143 Å and 72 Å are 1% greater than from a live relaxed muscle at rest-length. It is deduced that the initial movement of cross-bridges from their positions in resting muscle does not depend on the interaction of each cross-bridge with actin, but on a conformational change in the backbone of the myosin filament: occurring as a result of activation. The possibility is discussed that the conformational change occurs because the myosin filament, like the actin filament, has an activation control mechanism. Finally, all the X-ray diffraction patterns are interpreted on a model in which the myosin filament can exist in one of two possible states: a relaxed state which gives a diffraction pattern with strong myosin layer lines and an axial spacing of 143.4 Å, and an activated state which gives no layer lines but a meridional spacing of 144.8 Å."

  "abstract": "Population indices based on visits to detection stations commonly are used to monitor wildlife populations. Inferences about populations are based on 1 of 2 measures: (1) change in the proportion of stations visited at least once or (2) change in the cumulative number of visits by unique individuals. The functional relationships between index responses and population density is poorly understood and can lead to misinterpretation of index data when an incorrect functional relationship (e.g. linear) is assumed. We created a flexible simulation environment to study the response of detection-based population indices under a wide variety of conditions meant to reflect species life history and study design. Proportional indices exhibited non-linear saturating responses to changes in population density while cumulative indices responded linearly. Shapes of responses were functions of home range sizes, individual detection probabilities, and spatial arrangement of animals and sampling stations. Non-linear relationships of proportional indices lead to under-estimation of mean population density when data are aggregated from multiple detection stations deployed in a heterogeneous landscape. Cumulative indices have significant statistical advantages over proportional indices including smaller sample sizes required to detect density change, linearity, consistent index responses across a wide range of densities, and ability to aggregate data to meet minimum sample size requirements. Our simulation provides a flexible tool for the interpretation of station-based population indices."

  "abstract": "Some dietary fibers originated from insects such as silkworm (Sericin) and others along with constituents of several representative seaweeds such as wakame Undaria pinnatifida; hijiki Hizikia fusifome; and kombu Laminaria japonica, were found to have fairly large reaction rates determined by quenching experiments of emission spectra in the near-infrared region lambdamax 1270 nm for singlet oxygen 1O2, Cypridina luminescence method for superoxide, and peroxide value (POV) for autoxidation. The determined reaction rates are between 10(3)-10(5) (g/L)(-1) s(-1) for the insect and the plant dietary fibers; the larger ones are as large as that of ascorbic acid, 1.93 x 10(4) (g/L)(-1) s(-1) for singlet oxygen. Most of these seaweed constituents also showed antioxidative activity against autoxidation and superoxide as well as their immunological enhancing activity. These results suggest a possibility that dietary fibers that are supposed to prevent the large-intestine cancer by their physical properties may prevent the cancer, at least in parts, by their chemical, antioxidative activity."

These mechanisms enhance the capabilities of the rovers and their in situ science instruments, specifically the Microscopic-Imager (MI) and Mössbauer Spectrometer (MB), located on the end of the rover's robotic arm. The MI Dust Cover mechanism covers the lens of the Microscopic-Imager protecting it from dust and incidental contact while the instrument is not in use. The cover opens when the MI is positioned over a ta rget and closes after a series of images has been taken. The MI and MB contact sensors, as their name implies, sense contact with the Martian surface, indicating that the instrument is positioned at the proper distance from the target and can begin taking measurements."

This mixed solvent has been used in order to obtain higher concentrations of acetazolamide in solution. For copper(II) and nickel(II), the binuclear species [Cu 2 (Acm) 2 ] and [Ni 2 (Acm) 3 ] 2− are detected in both solvents together with hydroxo species. The values of the stability constants are always higher in the mixed solvent than in water. For cobalt(II) and zinc(II), while in aqueous solution the hydrolysis of these metal ions prevented the formation of any complex, in water-ethanol 50 vol. % the metal complexes are stable enough to allow their formation. For zinc(II), the model system consists of the species [Zn(Acm)] and [Zn(Acm) 2 ] 2− , while for cobalt(II), of just [Co(Acm) 2 ] 2− . To be noticed, the inversion in the stepwise stability constant observed for zinc(II), which suggests changes in stereochemistry when [Zn(Acm) 2 ] 2− is formed."

  "abstract": "A metal-oxide semiconductor(MOS) structure was developed using raised coplanar waveguides(CPW) fabricated on a high-resistivity silicon(HRS) substrate with a resistivity ρ>8 kΩ·cm.The insert and return losses of the CPW lines were measured from 50 MHz to 40 GHz with the scattering parameters also characterised with DC biases of from-40 V to +40 V.The results show the frequency and amplitude of the maximum return losses,as well as the amplitudes of the maximum insert losses and the drift with the bias within the Ka band.No frequency drifts of the insert losses were found for different DC biases.The loss variations with the bias are due to the Si-SiO2 interface effect.The loss-bias curve of this CPW is very different from that of a traditional MOS CPW,which is explained theoretically.The CPW lines achieve an attenuation coefficient lower than-0.010 dB/mm at 35 GHz,which is the best known result for coplanar waveguides on silicon substrates in the Ka-band."

  "abstract": "Human prostatic cancer cells have a remarkably low rate of proliferation even when they have metastasized to the bone and have become androgen independent (Berges et al., Clin. Cancer Res., 1:473-480, 1995). Due to this low proliferation, patients with such androgen-independent metastatic prostatic cancer cells are rarely treated successfully with the presently available chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, new approaches are urgently needed which are not dependent on the rate of cancer cell proliferation for their effectiveness. One such approach is to inhibit the angiogenic response within localized and metastatic cancer deposits, since the resultant hypoxia-induced tumor cell death does not require cell proliferation. We have previously demonstrated that the quinoline-3-carboxamide, linomide, is an p.o. active agent which inhibits tumor angiogenesis and thus blood flow in a variety of rat prostatic cancers independent of their growth rate, androgen sensitivity, or metastatic ability. Because of its antiangiogenic effects, linomide treatment induces the hypoxic death of rat prostatic cancer cells, thus inhibiting their net growth and metastases. To determine whether human prostatic cancer cells are similarly sensitive to hypoxia-induced death caused by linomide inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, androgen-independent TSU and PC-3 human prostatic cancer cells were xenotransplanted into SCID mice that were either untreated or treated p.o. with linomide. These studies demonstrated that linomide treatment decreases microvessel density in both androgen-independent human prostatic cancers. Microvessel density was decreased from 1.8 +/- 0.4% of the total area in control tumors to 1.0 +/- 0.2% in linomide-treated TSU tumors [i.e., a 44% decrease in microvessel density (P < 0.05)]. Similarly, a 56% decrease (P < 0.05) was observed in the microvessel density of PC-3 tumors (i.e., 2.7 +/- 0.8% of the area in control tumor versus 1.2 +/- 0.2% in the linomide-treated tumors). This inhibition of angiogenesis increased cell death in both TSU and PC-3 cancer cells. This is reflected in both an increase in the area of necrosis and an increase in the apoptotic index in non-necrotic areas. In untreated TSU tumors, 40 +/- 2% of tumor volume was necrotic. Linomide treatment increased this necrotic percentage to 59 +/- 2% [i.e., 48% increase (P < 0.05)]. Linomide therapy also increased apoptotic cell death in non-necrotic tumor areas. In the untreated TSU tumors, 2.9 +/- 0.6% of tumor cells were apoptotic in the non-necrotic areas, and in the linomide-treated TSU tumors this percentage increased to 3.6 +/- 0.4% [i.e., 24% increase (P < 0.05)].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Horizontal wind comparisons for two orthogonal components are carried out in a statistical sense, i.e., using correlation coefficients, mean differences, standard deviation of differences, and percentage of failures. We find that a simple technique that assumes horizontally isotropic scattering compares very closely with the more complicated full correlation analysis techniques. Techniques that attempt to correct for turbulence appear to be very sensitive to the way we estimate the width of the cross-correlation/spectra functions. This is particularly true above 15 km, where discrepancies in the wind speed are apparent. In general, all techniques give essentially the same wind direction."

This benign cutaneous tumour had a diagnostic microscopic appearance that consisted of multiple dilated ducts lined by two or more layers of cells. The inner layer often formed intraluminal papillary projections of variable complexity. The lumina were filled by eosinophilic amorphous material. Immunoperoxidase studies showed carcino-embryonic antigen in the luminal border of the ducts, but S-100 protein was absent for tumoral ducts. We discuss the eccrine and apocrine differentiation of this neoplasm on the basis of the immunoperoxidase results. The differential diagnosis includes other cutaneous neoplasms with intraductal papillary proliferation."

  "abstract": "Hydrolysis of glycerol trioleate by human leucocytes was characterized and the enzymes responsible for this activity were obtained in a purified form by means of gel chromatography on Sephadex G-100 as well as by zonal ultracentrifugation followed by gel chromatography. The activity is localized in the granule fraction of leucocytes (15 000 X g, 20 min) and shows a sharp pH optimum at pH 5.25. As judged from the elution profile obtained by gel chromatography, two proteins are likely to contribute to the hydrolysis of glycerol trioleate. The approximate molecular weights of the two enzymes are 74 100 and 60 300, respectively. The activity is reduced in the presence of NaCl, KCl, CaCl2 as well as of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. The enzymes are stable at -25 degrees C but loose about 50% of their activity within 48 h at 4 degrees C."

  "abstract": "Influenza viruses continue to pose a severe threat worldwide, causing thousands of deaths and an enormous economic loss every year. The major problem in fighting influenza is the high genetic variability of the virus, resulting in the rapid formation of variants that escape the acquired immunity against previous virus strains, or have resistance to antiviral agents. Every virus depends on its host cell and, hence, cellular functions that are essential for viral replication might be suitable targets for antiviral therapy. As a result, intracellular signaling cascades induced by the virus, in particular mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, have recently come into focus."

  "abstract": "Objective To test the hypothesis that a community based intervention by secondary child and adolescent mental health services would be significantly more effective and less costly than a hospital based intervention. Design Open study with two randomised parallel groups. Setting Two health districts in the north of England. Participants Parents of 3 to 10 year old children with behavioural disorder who had been referred to child and adolescent mental health services. Intervention Parental education groups. Main outcome measures Parents' and teachers' reports of the child's behaviour, parental depression, parental criticism of the child, impact of the child's behaviour on the family. Results 141 subjects were randomised to community (n = 72) or hospital (n = 69) treatment. Primary outcome data were obtained on 115 (82%) cases a year later. Intention to treat analyses showed no significant differences between the community and hospital based groups on any of the outcome measures, or on costs. Parental depression was common and predicted the child's outcome. Conclusions Location of child mental health services may be less important than the range of services that they provide, which should include effective treatment for parents' mental health problems."

  "abstract": "This paper examines if there is a long-running equilibrium relationship between dually traded stocks traded on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) and the London Stock Ex- change (LSE). The unit root test concludes that each price series is non-stationary in the levels but stationary after first differencing. Both stock prices on SEHK and LSE are tested for co-integration using both the Johansen and Engle & Granger procedures. The co- integration analysis indicates that both stock prices on SEHK and LSE are co-integrated. The result of error correction model indicates that the adjustments to long-run equilibrium appear to be accomplished by stock prices of SEHK for some firms and by stock prices of LSE for some other firms. Some feedback exists between stock prices of the two markets. The results imply that the domestic market does not act as the dominant market and the foreign market does not act as a satellite market either."

  "abstract": "The vast majority of people don't use a scientific geographical vocabulary, nevertheless most use a wide variety of geographical terms on a day to day basis. Identifiers like \"Downtown\" or \"The grim area around the docks\" are part of a vernacular geographical terminology which is vastly more used than the coordinate systems and scientifically defined variables so beloved of professional geographers. These terms not only identify areas, but give members of our socio- linguistic group information about them, building up a jointly-defined cultural world-view within which we all act on a daily basis. Despite its importance for policy making and quality of life, attention is rarely paid to this vernacular geography because it is so hard to capture and use. This paper presents a new set of tools for capturing these \"fuzzy\" psychogeographical areas and their associated attributes, through a web based mapping system. The system contains a spraycan tool that allows users to tag information onto diffuse areas of varying density. An example of their use to define areas people consider are \"high crime\" within a UK city is also presented, along with users' responses to the system. Such a system aims to pull together professional and popular geographical understanding, to the advantage of both."

  "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the outcome of hyperthyroidism treated with surgical operation or 131Ⅰ. Methods Medical records of 367 patients with hyperthyroidism were analyzed retrospectively. There were 115 cases receiving surgical operation with 4-6 g of gland retained, including 74 cases of bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy and 41 cases of unilateral total thyroidectomy plus contralateral subtotal thyroidectomy. The other 252 cases received individualized treatment with 13lⅠ from 2.18 to 3.97 MBq/g (mean=3.42±1.24 MBq/g). Results There was no thyroid crisis and death in the eases with operation and 7 cases (6.1%) of complications disappeared in one month. During the follow-up of 1-5 years, 109 case (94.8%) healed, 2 case improved, 4 cases of mild hypothyroidism occurred, and 1 case of hyperthyroidism recurred. After taken 131Ⅰ, 219 cases (86.9%)healed, 12 case improved, 16 cases of early hypothyroidism occurred, 5 cases had no changes, and 9 cases of hyperthyroidism recurred, 8 cases of late hypothyroidism occurred. The ratio of healing in the patients with operation is significantly higher than that in the patients treated with 13IⅠ (P<0.05), but there was no difference in recurrence rate between these 2 groups (P>0.05). Conclusions The outcome of the 2 groups is ideal. Surgical operation and receiving 131Ⅰ both has superiority, and should be chosen according to the patients' symptom or physical conditions."

  "abstract": "Effects of several sulfhydryl reagents on the reaction of renin and angiotensinogen were investigated by measuring the production of angiotensin I. Renin and angiotensinogen were prepared from the kidneys of dogs and from plasma of nephrectomized dogs, respectively. The amount of angiotensin I generated was increased with application of dithiothreitol, dithioerythritol and 2,3-mercapto-1-propanol. The greatest enhancement of the generation of angiotensin I was observed with dithiothreitol. Dithiothreitol had no influence on renin activity, on radioimmunoassay for angiotensin I and the recovery of synthetic angiotensin I from the incubation medium. When heterologous angiotensinogen was used, a great enhancement of generation of angiotensin I was observed. Dithiothreitol did not accelerate the reaction following replacement of the natural substrate, angiotensinogen, with the synthetic tetradecapeptide as substrate. It is postulated that dithiothreitol augments angiotensin I generation by acting on the angiotensinogen and not on the renin."

  "abstract": "The real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology has become increasingly popular for nucleic acids detection and/or quantification. As primer/probe design and experimental evaluation is time-consuming, we developed a public database application for the storage and retrieval of validated real-time PCR primer and probe sequence records. The integrity and accuracy of the data are maintained by linking to and querying other reference databases. RTPrimerDB provides free public access through the Web to perform queries and submit user based information. Primer/probe records can be searched for by official gene symbol, nucleotide sequence, type of application, detection chemistry, LocusLink or Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) identifier, and submitter's name. Each record is directly linked to LocusLink, dbSNP and/or PubMed to retrieve additional information on the gene/SNP for which the primers/probes are designed. Currently, the database contains primer/probe records for human, mouse, rat, fruit fly and zebrafish, and all current detection chemistries such as intercalating dyes (SYBR Green I), hydrolysis probes (Taqman), adjacent hybridizations probes and molecular beacons. Real-time PCR primer/probe records are available at http://www.realtimeprimerdatabase.ht.st."
